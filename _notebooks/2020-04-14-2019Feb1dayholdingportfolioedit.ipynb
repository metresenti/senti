CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $54,507,000 IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $33,699,000 IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018. ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WERE $30,468,000 IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED TO $21,120,000 IN FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018. THE COMPANY RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF VARIOUS ASSETS FROM MODESTO AND BUHL WHICH TOTALED $84,975,000 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  IN APRIL 2017, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE OTHER 50% OF TRUITT BROS., INC. FOR $14,420,000 (NET OF CASH ACQUIRED).  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $103,211,000 IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH INCLUDED BORROWINGS OF $419,102,000 AND THE REPAYMENT OF $517,187,000 OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PRINCIPALLY CONSISTING OF BORROWINGS AND REPAYMENTS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\\u201cREVOLVER\\u201d). THE COMPANY MADE ADDITIONAL REPAYMENTS ON THE REVOLVER FROM CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF MODESTO AND BUHL ASSETS.  OTHER THAN BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER, THERE WAS NO NEW LONG-TERM DEBT DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018 OTHER THAN THE $13,470,000 ACQUIRED VIA THE ACQUISITION OF TRUITT BROS., INC. OF WHICH $3,515,000 WAS PAID OFF IMMEDIATELY. THE COMPANY REPURCHASED $5,340,000 AND $3,442,000 OF STOCK DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (UNAUDITED)  DECEMBER 29, 2018  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ON JULY 5, 2016. AVAILABLE BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVER TOTAL $400,000,000 FROM APRIL THROUGH JULY AND $500,000,000 FROM AUGUST THROUGH MARCH WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JULY 5, 2021.  THE INTEREST RATE ON THE REVOLVER IS BASED ON LIBOR PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN BASED ON EXCESS AVAILABILITY AND THE COMPANY'S FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, THE INTEREST RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.01% ON A BALANCE OF $214,161,000. WE BELIEVE THAT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVER AND OTHER FINANCING SOURCES WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN STANDARD REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EVENTS OF DEFAULT, AND CERTAIN AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS. THE COMPANY IS IN VIOLATION OF A FARM CREDIT TERM LOAN COVENANT REQUIREMENT AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, BUT OBTAINED A WAIVER FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  A MORE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT MUST BE MET AT MARCH 31, 2019, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL FAIL TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT AT THAT DATE, UNLESS AN ADDITIONAL WAIVER OR AMENDMENT IS OBTAINED.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE FARM CREDIT TERM LOAN, AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO AMEND THE FARM CREDIT COVENANTS ON A LONGER TERM BASIS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER.  IN ADDITION, THE REVOLVER AGREEMENT CONTAINS A CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISION.   THE REVOLVER AGREEMENT HAS TRIGGERED AN EVENT OF DEFAULT AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, DUE TO THE FARM CREDIT LOAN DEFAULT.  A WAIVER WAS OBTAINED FROM THE LENDER TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY RELIEF OF DEFAULT AS OF THIS MEASUREMENT DATE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE REVOLVER WILL BE IN DEFAULT AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FARM CREDIT DEFAULT THUS TRIGGERING A CROSS-DEFAULT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE REVOLVER SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  REFER TO FOOTNOTE 11 OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SEASONALITY  THE COMPANY'S REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY HIGHER IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS. THIS IS DUE IN PART BECAUSE THE COMPANY SELLS, ON A BILL AND HOLD BASIS, GREEN GIANT CANNED AND FROZEN VEGETABLES TO B&G EITHER WEEKLY DURING PRODUCTION FOR SPECIALTY ITEMS, OR AT THE END OF EACH PACK CYCLE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS DURING THESE QUARTERS. B&G BUYS THE PRODUCT FROM THE COMPANY AT COST PLUS A SPECIFIED FEE FOR EACH EQUIVALENT CASE. SEE THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SECTION BELOW FOR FURTHER DETAILS. THE COMPANY\\u2019S NON-GREEN GIANT SALES ALSO EXHIBIT SEASONALITY WITH THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER GENERATING THE HIGHEST RETAIL SALES DUE TO HOLIDAYS THAT OCCUR DURING THAT QUARTER.

INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON SUCH STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY TO EVENTS AS OF THE DATE THE STATEMENTS WERE MADE. AMONG THE FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY ARE.  \\u25cf  GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS;  \\u25cf  COST AND AVAILABILITY OF COMMODITIES AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS VEGETABLES, STEEL AND PACKAGING MATERIALS;  \\u25cf  TRANSPORTATION COSTS;  \\u25cf  CLIMATE AND WEATHER AFFECTING GROWING CONDITIONS AND CROP YIELDS;  \\u25cf  THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING;  \\u25cf  LEVERAGE AND THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO SERVICE AND REDUCE ITS DEBT;  \\u25cf  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS;  \\u25cf  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S MARKETING AND TRADE PROMOTION PROGRAMS;  \\u25cf  CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES;  \\u25cf  COMPETITION;  \\u25cf  PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS;  \\u25cf  THE LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS OR A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN ORDERS FROM THESE CUSTOMERS;  \\u25cf  CHANGES IN, OR THE FAILURE OR INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH, U.S., FOREIGN AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS; AND  \\u25cf  OTHER RISKS DETAILED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE REPORTS FILED BY THE COMPANY WITH THE SEC.  EXCEPT FOR ONGOING OBLIGATIONS TO DISCLOSE MATERIAL INFORMATION AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT UNDERTAKE ANY OBLIGATION TO RELEASE PUBLICLY ANY REVISIONS TO ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS REPORT OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018, THE COMPANY SOLD $65,741,000 OF GREEN GIANT FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY TO B&G FOODS NORTH AMERICA (\\u201cB&G\\u201d) FOR CASH, ON A BILL AND HOLD BASIS, AS COMPARED TO $112,768,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2017. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BILL AND HOLD AGREEMENT, TITLE TO THE SPECIFIED INVENTORY TRANSFERRED TO B&G. UNDER THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD, THIS CONTRACT QUALIFIES FOR BILL AND HOLD ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AS THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT CONTROL OF THE UNLABELED PRODUCTS TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER AT THE TIME TITLE TRANSFERS AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO PAYMENT (PRIOR TO PHYSICAL DELIVERY), WHICH RESULTS IN EARLIER REVENUE RECOGNITION. LABELING AND STORAGE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED AFTER CONTROL OF THE GOODS HAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH REVENUE IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  TRADE PROMOTIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE SALES AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BRANDED PRODUCTS, AND ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUPPORT OF THE BUSINESS. TRADE PROMOTION COSTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF NET SALES, INCLUDE AMOUNTS PAID TO ENCOURAGE RETAILERS TO OFFER TEMPORARY PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS, AMOUNTS PAID TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE DISPLAY POSITIONS IN RETAILERS\\u2019 STORES, AND AMOUNTS PAID TO RETAILERS FOR SHELF SPACE IN RETAIL STORES. ACCRUALS FOR TRADE PROMOTIONS ARE RECORDED PRIMARILY AT THE TIME OF SALE OF PRODUCT TO THE RETAILER BASED ON EXPECTED LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE. SETTLEMENT OF THESE LIABILITIES TYPICALLY OCCURS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS PRIMARILY THROUGH AN AUTHORIZED PROCESS FOR DEDUCTIONS TAKEN BY A RETAILER FROM AMOUNTS OTHERWISE DUE TO US. AS A RESULT, THE ULTIMATE COST OF A TRADE PROMOTION PROGRAM IS DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE SUCCESS OF THE EVENTS AND THE ACTIONS AND LEVEL OF DEDUCTIONS TAKEN BY RETAILERS FOR AMOUNTS THEY CONSIDER DUE TO THEM. FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE PERMISSIBLE DEDUCTIONS MAY TAKE EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (UNAUDITED)  DECEMBER 29, 2018  THE COMPANY USES THE LOWER OF COST, DETERMINED UNDER THE LIFO (LAST-IN, FIRST OUT) METHOD, OR MARKET, TO VALUE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVENTORIES. IN A HIGH INFLATION ENVIRONMENT THAT THE COMPANY WAS EXPERIENCING, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE LIFO METHOD WAS PREFERABLE OVER THE FIFO METHOD BECAUSE IT BETTER COMPARES THE COST OF CURRENT PRODUCTION TO CURRENT REVENUE.  THE COMPANY ASSESSES ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER THERE IS AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ASSIGNED LIVES. THE ASSIGNED LIVES AND THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS USED TO TEST IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECTIVE. IF ACTUAL LIVES ARE SHORTER THAN ANTICIPATED OR IF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN ANTICIPATED, A FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OR A LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF THE ASSETS COULD BE INCURRED. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE EVALUATED IF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IF SUCH IS THE CASE, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"Seneca Foods Corp\", \"CIK\": 88948, \"Date\": \"2019-02-01T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"SENEA\", \"Name\": \"Seneca Foods Corp\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 2033.0, \"Business\": \"NY\", \"Incorporated\": \"NY\", \"IRS\": 160733425.0, \"key\": \"20190201SENEA\", \"labelr1\": 4.28720808644127, \"labelr2\": -0.4679144385026757, \"labelr3\": 0.0, \"labelr4\": -0.6715916722632734, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5438179, \"prof1\": 0.4561821, \"return1&2\": 0.9616064588641628, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9616064588641628, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.9680645277618404, \"return2\": 1.0046791443850267, \"return1\": 0.9571279191355871, \"return3\": 1.0, \"return4\": 1.0067159167226327, \"1_day_return\": 4.287208086441273, \"cumulative_return1\": 1.478410407068241, \"cumulative_return1&2\": 1.0765577898051422, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": 0.6128270158557668, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.7139048627634919, \"indexx\": 55, \"returnpred\": -4.28720808644127, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.000528734784956, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.000528734784956, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9962752455260626, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0067762366585589, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0070012480753874}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 64, \"level_0\": 66, \"index\": 13956, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE PRIOR PERIODS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO ONE-TIME TAX BENEFITS FROM THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE TAX ACT) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018.

ARGENTINA  THE COMPANY OPERATES IN ARGENTINA THROUGH CERTAIN WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, \\u201cCLOROX ARGENTINA\\u201d). NET SALES FROM CLOROX ARGENTINA REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 2% AND 3% OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. TOTAL ASSETS OF CLOROX ARGENTINA WERE APPROXIMATELY 1% OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  . THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN ARGENTINA CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE CONTINUING SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN ARGENTINA\\u2019S CURRENCY, HIGH INFLATION AND ECONOMIC RECESSION.  25  EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2018, UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), ARGENTINA WAS DESIGNATED AS A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMY, SINCE IT HAS EXPERIENCED CUMULATIVE INFLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 100 PERCENT OR MORE OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING JULY 1, 2018, THE U.S. DOLLAR REPLACED THE ARGENTINE PESO AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES IN ARGENTINA. CONSEQUENTLY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR CLOROX ARGENTINA ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY IS CLOSELY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS IN ARGENTINA AND CONTINUES TO TAKE STEPS INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE CONDITIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THESE CONDITIONS AS THEY MAY OCCUR.  CORPORATE  CERTAIN NON-ALLOCATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND VARIOUS OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REFLECTED IN CORPORATE. CORPORATE ASSETS INCLUDE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, OTHER INVESTMENTS AND DEFERRED TAXES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOWER TAX PAYMENTS, MAINLY DUE TO BENEFITS FROM THE TAX ACT, TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO VENDORS AND TIMING OF COLLECTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY BALANCE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $77 IN THE CURRENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD WAS RELATIVELY FLAT VERSUS $74 IN THE PRIOR SIX-MONTH PERIOD.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $338 IN THE CURRENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD, COMPARED WITH  $177  IN THE PRIOR SIX-MONTH PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASES, A DECREASE IN CASH SOURCED FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND HIGHER DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WILL HAVE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO MEET ITS FINANCING REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FIXED OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE BASED ON ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, ANTICIPATED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE, INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATINGS, DEMONSTRATED ACCESS TO LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT MARKETS AND CURRENT BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ASSESS ITS ABILITY TO FULLY DRAW ON ITS CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND CURRENTLY EXPECTS THAT ANY DRAWING ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE FULLY FUNDED.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY MAINTAINED $38 OF FOREIGN AND OTHER CREDIT LINES, OF WHICH $2 WAS OUTSTANDING.  LONG-TERM BORROWINGS  IN SEPTEMBER 2017, THE COMPANY ISSUED $400 OF SENIOR NOTES WITH AN ANNUAL FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 3.10% AND USED THE PROCEEDS TO REPAY $400 OF SENIOR NOTES WITH AN ANNUAL FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 5.95% THAT BECAME DUE IN OCTOBER 2017.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INCLUDED IN THIS MD&A AND THE REASONS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THEY ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.  THESE MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  IN ADDITION, THESE MEASURES MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS SIMILARLY NAMED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE COMPANY USES THE TERM  CONSOLIDATED EBITDA  , WHICH IS A FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP,  BECAUSE IT IS A TERM USED IN ITS CREDIT AGREEMENT. AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, CONSOLIDATED EBITDA REPRESENTS EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO  IS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED EBITDA TO INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES DISCLOSURE OF CONSOLIDATED EBITDA PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT IS USED IN THE PRIMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANT IN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT.

LOWER RESULTS AT ESPN WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE TAX ACT IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS DETERMINED ON INCOME AFTER ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES, FINANCING COSTS AND INCOME TAXES, AS APPLICABLE.  SEASONALITY  THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF SEASONALITY. CONSEQUENTLY, THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE  QUARTER  ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT, AND FOR THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE, ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE FULL YEAR.  MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS, CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS AND TIMING OF PROGRAM SALES. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE FEES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASC 606, WHICH CHANGED THE TIMING OF AFFILIATE REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN HIGHER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR.  PARKS, EXPERIENCES & CONSUMER PRODUCTS REVENUES FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL AND LEISURE ACTIVITIES AND SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN INCREASED REVENUES DURING THE COMPANY\\u2019S FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS. IN ADDITION, LICENSING REVENUES FLUCTUATE WITH THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.  STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.  DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER & INTERNATIONAL REVENUES FLUCTUATE BASED ON: THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES OF OUR DIGITAL MEDIA CONTENT; VIEWERSHIP LEVELS ON OUR CABLE CHANNELS AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS; CHANGES IN SUBSCRIBER LEVELS; AND THE DEMAND FOR SPORTS AND DISNEY CONTENT. EACH OF THESE MAY DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CONTENT, WHICH VARIES FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SPORTS SEASONS AND CONTENT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES.  33  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME, WHICH IS SHOWN BELOW ALONG WITH SEGMENT REVENUES.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED $248 MILLION TO $1.0 BILLION DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPENDING ON NEW ATTRACTIONS AT OUR DOMESTIC THEME PARKS AND RESORTS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT MEDIA NETWORKS PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR EXPANDING AND UPGRADING BROADCAST CENTERS, PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND TELEVISION STATION FACILITIES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER & INTERNATIONAL REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT CORPORATE PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS ITS FISCAL  2019  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2018 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $4.5 BILLION DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENTS AT OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS.  OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE 21CF, WHICH, IF COMPLETED, WILL REQUIRE $35.7 BILLION OF CASH AND APPROXIMATELY $35.6 BILLION IN STOCK CONSIDERATION (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.4 BILLION  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, WHICH REFLECTED REPAYMENTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $0.4 BILLION  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS $0.2 BILLION LESS THAN THE  $0.6 BILLION  USED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER AS A DECREASE OF $1.3 BILLION DUE TO NO REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (COMPARED TO $1.3 BILLION PURCHASED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD) WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO A NET INCREASE IN BORROWINGS IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD ($0.3 BILLION DECREASE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO $0.8 BILLION INCREASE IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD).  44  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BORROWING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  QUARTER  ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S BANK FACILITIES. THE COMPANY MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS UNUSED BANK FACILITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.  SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S DIVIDENDS IN FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  . DURING THE  QUARTER  ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO HOLD AS TREASURY SHARES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY\\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND THE CASH CONSIDERATION IN THE PENDING ACQUISITION OF 21CF, ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANY\\u2019S BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , MOODY\\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, STANDARD AND POOR\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A+ AND A-1+, AND FITCH\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND F1, RESPECTIVELY. EACH OF MOODY\\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE, STANDARD AND POOR\\u2019S AND FITCH HAD PLACED THE COMPANY\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS ON REVIEW FOR DOWNGRADE AS A RESULT OF THE PENDING ACQUISITION OF 21CF. ON OCTOBER 8, 2018, MOODY\\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICE AFFIRMED THE COMPANY\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK FOLLOWING ITS REVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION. ON JANUARY 18, 2019, FITCH AFFIRMED THE COMPANY\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A AND F1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS STANDARD AND POOR\\u2019S TO FINALIZE ITS REVIEW OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S DEBT RATINGS UPON CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION AND MAY DOWNGRADE OUR LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS. SHOULD A DOWNGRADE OCCUR, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WOULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE COMPANY\\u2019S BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANY\\u2019S BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE ASIA THEME PARKS, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  LEGAL MATTERS  AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS.  GUARANTEES  SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S GUARANTEES.  TAX MATTERS  AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN TAX MATTERS.  CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS  SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS.  OTHER MATTERS  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IN ADDITION, FOR OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  45  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS  WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD\\u2019S REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASES, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.  WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G., THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OR TELEVISION MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE POPULARITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILM\\u2019S RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY\\u2019S ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE LEVEL OF EXPECTED HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VARY BASED ON THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.  WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES ARE PROGRAM RATINGS AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE LICENSING OF PROGRAM RIGHTS WORLDWIDE TO TELEVISION DISTRIBUTORS, SVOD SERVICES AND IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE PROGRAM, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AN IMMEDIATE WRITE-DOWN OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES.  WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED SERIES, MOVIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAM\\u2019S RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. WE AMORTIZE RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF EACH YEAR IS BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASON\\u2019S ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF PLANNED USAGE PATTERNS OR ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUES BY YEAR WERE TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, AMORTIZATION OF OUR SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.  COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS, WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANY\\u2019S DAYPARTS ARE: PRIMETIME, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, NEWS AND SPORTS (INCLUDES BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE NETWORK. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. WE HAVE UPDATED OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FEES CHARGED FOR THE RIGHT TO USE OUR TELEVISION AND MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTIONS ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CONTENT IS AVAILABLE FOR USE BY THE LICENSEE. TV/SVOD DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE TITLE AND/OR PROVIDE THAT CERTAIN TITLES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR USE DURING DEFINED PERIODS OF TIME DURING THE CONTRACT TERM. IN THESE INSTANCES, EACH TITLE AND/OR PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. FOR THESE CONTRACTS, LICENSE FEES ARE ALLOCATED TO EACH TITLE AND PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY AT CONTRACT INCEPTION BASED ON RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE USING MANAGEMENT\\u2019S BEST  46  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  ESTIMATE. ESTIMATES USED TO DETERMINE A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\\u2019 STANDALONE SELLING PRICE IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, BUT NOT THE TOTAL REVENUE TO BE RECOGNIZED UNDER THE ARRANGEMENTS.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS  THE COMPANY\\u2019S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT, WHICH WE EVALUATE ANNUALLY. REFER TO THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ESTIMATED IMPACTS OF CHANGES IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.  THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. THE COMPANY\\u2019S DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AND REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF THE PLANS\\u2019 LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.  TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE.  GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, AND TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT.  TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. WE BELIEVE OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW A MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANT WOULD VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS.  IN TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY\\u2019S LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.  THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY A GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUP\\u2019S LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUP\\u2019S LONG-LIVED ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSET\\u2019S FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE. DETERMINING WHETHER A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS IMPAIRED REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ASSET GROUPS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT ASSET GROUPS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  47  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS THE FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEES AND MARKET VALUES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET OR MARKET VALUES INDICATE AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  WE EVALUATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND ESTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IS TOO LOW, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND IF IT IS TOO HIGH, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION  WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES AND HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AS APPROPRIATE. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ALSO BE INVOLVED IN OTHER CONTINGENT MATTERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES FOR A PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSS. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING OTHER CONTINGENT MATTERS. SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.  INCOME TAX AUDITS  AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL, WHERE APPROPRIATE, AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANY\\u2019S SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  MARKET RISK  THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANY\\u2019S EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.  OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  48  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, CHINESE YUAN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES. THE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY.  OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.  IT IS THE COMPANY\\u2019S POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.  49\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"WALT DISNEY CO/\", \"CIK\": 1001039, \"Date\": \"2019-02-05T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"DIS\", \"Name\": \"Walt Disney Co\", \"Exchange\": \"NYSE\", \"SIC\": 4841.0, \"Business\": \"CA\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 954545390.0, \"key\": \"20190205DIS\", \"labelr1\": -1.1095331084679567, \"labelr2\": -0.4128893277084586, \"labelr3\": 0.5047318611987403, \"labelr4\": -1.8563357546408457, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5426671999999999, \"prof1\": 0.45733282, \"return1&2\": 1.0152700357996869, \"return1&2&3\": 1.0101456444518018, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.0288973392237075, \"return2\": 1.0041288932770849, \"return1\": 1.0110953310846795, \"return3\": 0.9949526813880126, \"return4\": 1.0185633575464084, \"1_day_return\": -1.1095331084679527, \"cumulative_return1\": 1.5312798549635964, \"cumulative_return1&2\": 1.313837538632712, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": 0.8175422270543371, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.7660281793218008, \"indexx\": 70, \"returnpred\": 1.1095331084679567, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9926481419823074, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.012718113584723, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9825963537510458, \"cumreturndow\": 1.009266506460771, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0130231240186802}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 84, \"level_0\": 86, \"index\": 20112, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW  GENERAL  CLEARFIELD, INC.  DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES FIBER PROTECTION, FIBER MANAGEMENT AND FIBER DELIVERY SOLUTIONS TO ENABLE RAPID AND  COST-EFFECTIVE FIBER-FED DEPLOYMENT THROUGHOUT THE BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDER SPACE ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. OUR \\u201cFIBER TO ANYWHERE\\u201d  PLATFORM SERVES THE UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS OF LEADING INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (TRADITIONAL CARRIERS), WIRELESS OPERATORS,  MSO/CABLE TV COMPANIES, AND COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (ALTERNATIVE CARRIERS), WHILE ALSO CATERING TO THE BROADBAND NEEDS  OF THE UTILITY/MUNICIPALITY, ENTERPRISE, DATA CENTER, AND MILITARY MARKETS.  THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES  BUILD-TO-PRINT SERVICES FOR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEM) REQUIRING COPPER AND FIBER CABLE ASSEMBLIES BUILT TO THEIR SPECIFICATIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY FOCUSED ON THE  UN-SERVED OR UNDER-SERVED RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT RECEIVE THEIR VOICE, VIDEO AND DATA SERVICES FROM INDEPENDENT TELEPHONE COMPANIES.  BY ALIGNING ITS IN-HOUSE ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE ALONGSIDE ITS CUSTOMERS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP, CUSTOMIZE  AND ENHANCE PRODUCTS FROM DESIGN THROUGH PRODUCTION. FINAL BUILD AND ASSEMBLY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PRODUCTS IS COMPLETED AT CLEARFIELD\\u2019S  PLANTS IN BROOKLYN PARK, MINNESOTA, AND MEXICO, WITH MANUFACTURING SUPPORT FROM A NETWORK OF DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL MANUFACTURING  PARTNERS. CLEARFIELD SPECIALIZES IN PRODUCING THESE PRODUCTS ON BOTH A QUICK-TURN AND SCHEDULED DELIVERY BASIS. THE COMPANY DEPLOYS  A HYBRID SALES MODEL WITH SOME SALES MADE DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER, SOME MADE THROUGH TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION (CHANNEL) PARTNERS,  AND SOME SALES THROUGH ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS WHO PRIVATE LABEL THEIR PRODUCTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 VS. THREE  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WERE $20,089,000, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 19% OR $3,222,000, FROM NET SALES OF $16,867,000 FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. NET SALES TO BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE $18,800,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 VERSUS  $16,020,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018. AMONG THIS GROUP, THE COMPANY RECORDED $1,585,000 IN INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 VERSUS $1,369,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018. NET SALES TO BUILD-TO-PRINT CUSTOMERS WERE $1,289,000  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 VERSUS $847,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018. THE COMPANY ALLOCATES SALES FROM EXTERNAL  CUSTOMERS TO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS BASED ON THE LOCATION TO WHICH THE PRODUCT IS TRANSPORTED. ACCORDINGLY, INTERNATIONAL SALES REPRESENTED  8% OF TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF BOTH FISCAL 2019 AND 2018.  11  THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 OF $3,222,000 COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES  TO AN OEM MANUFACTURER IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,732,000 DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF OUR ACTIVE CABINET LINE IN FEBRUARY 2018. ADDITIONALLY,  SALES TO BUILD-TO-PRINT CUSTOMERS INCREASED $442,000 DURING THE SAME PERIOD DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEMAND. REVENUE FROM ALL CUSTOMERS  IS OBTAINED FROM PURCHASE ORDERS SUBMITTED FROM TIME TO TIME. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO PREDICT ORDERS IN FUTURE  PERIODS OR TRENDS AFFECTING ORDERS IN FUTURE PERIODS IS LIMITED.  COST OF SALES FOR  THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS $12,142,000, AN INCREASE OF $2,384,000, OR 24%, FROM $9,758,000 IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  FISCAL 2018. GROSS PROFIT PERCENT WAS 39.6% IN THE FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER, DOWN FROM 42.1% FOR THE FISCAL 2018 FIRST QUARTER.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $839,000, OR 12%, TO $7,947,000 FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $7,108,000 IN THE COMPARABLE  PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.  THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME WHILE  THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ACQUIRED ACTIVE CABINET LINE INTO  ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AS WELL AS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PRODUCTS, WHICH HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED $312,000, OR 5%, TO $6,776,000 IN THE FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER FROM $6,464,000 FOR THE FISCAL 2018 FIRST QUARTER. THE  INCREASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF AN INCREASE  OF $627,000 IN COMPENSATION COSTS DUE PRIMARILY TO ADDITIONAL SALES AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL AND AN INCREASE OF $120,000 OF DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. THESE WERE SOMEWHAT OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $624,000 IN LEGAL EXPENSES, MAINLY DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT  OF A PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT THAT OCCURRED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $1,171,000 COMPARED TO INCOME FROM OPERATIONS OF $644,000 FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, AN INCREASE  OF APPROXIMATELY 82%. THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED GROSS PROFIT, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SELLING, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  INTEREST INCOME FOR  THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $135,000 COMPARED TO $96,000 FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER FOR FISCAL 2018. THE INCREASE IS  DUE MAINLY TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES EARNED ON ITS INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2019. THE COMPANY INVESTS ITS EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN  FDIC-BACKED BANK CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS.  WE RECORDED A PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES OF $296,000 AND A BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES OF $203,000 FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  WE RECORD OUR QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR. THE INCREASE  IN TAX EXPENSE OF $499,000 FROM THE FIRST QUARTER FOR FISCAL 2018 IS PRIMARILY DUE  TO THE TAX REFORM ACT ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22,  2017 THAT RESULTED IN A LOWER FEDERAL TAX RATE AND A ONE-TIME BENEFIT OF $384,000 RELATED TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A REVALUATION  OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY THAT DECREASED THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  THE INCREASE IN THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATE TO 22.7% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FROM NEGATIVE 27.4% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2018 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ONE-TIME BENEFIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 FROM THE TAX REFORM ACT AS DESCRIBED.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S NET INCOME  FOR  THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $1,010,000, OR $0.08 PER BASIC AND DILUTED SHARE.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S NET INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WAS $943,000, OR $0.07 PER BASIC AND DILUTED SHARE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE  OF LIQUIDITY WAS OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THOSE SOURCES TOTAL $23,849,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED  TO $17,478,000 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. OUR EXCESS CASH IS INVESTED MAINLY IN CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT BACKED BY THE FDIC AND MONEY  MARKET ACCOUNTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FUNDS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC. INVESTMENTS CONSIDERED LONG-TERM WERE $18,292,000 AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018, COMPARED TO $17,974,000 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. WE BELIEVE THE COMBINED BALANCES OF SHORT-TERM CASH AND INVESTMENTS  ALONG WITH LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE INDICATION OF OUR AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY. WE HAD NO LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS  AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 OR SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  12  WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH EQUIVALENTS AND  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, ALONG WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS  FOR BEYOND THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  THE COMPANY INTENDS ON UTILIZING ITS AVAILABLE  CASH AND ASSETS PRIMARILY FOR ITS CONTINUED ORGANIC GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FUTURE STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS EXECUTION OF  THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ADOPTED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED ON NOVEMBER  13, 2014 WITH $8,000,000 AUTHORIZED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. ON APRIL 25, 2017, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE AUTHORIZATION  TO $12,000,000 OF COMMON STOCK.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED  $6,826,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $1,010,000, NON-CASH EXPENSES  FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF $529,000, AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OF $539,000 IN ADDITION TO CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES PROVIDING CASH. CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PROVIDING CASH INCLUDE DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  AND INVENTORIES OF $4,654,000 AND $424,000, RESPECTIVELY. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES CAN BE INFLUENCED BY THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS  FOR CUSTOMER PROJECTS AND PAYMENT TERMS. DAY\\u2019S SALES OUTSTANDING, WHICH MEASURES HOW QUICKLY RECEIVABLES ARE COLLECTED, DECREASED  15 DAYS TO 37 DAYS FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY REPRESENTS AN ADJUSTMENT FOR SEASONAL  DEMAND ALONG WITH CHANGES IN STOCKING LEVELS. CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS USING CASH INCLUDE A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,  ACCRUED EXPENSES AND DEFERRED RENT OF $432,000 WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTS FISCAL 2018 ACCRUED BONUS COMPENSATION ACCRUALS PAID IN  THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED  $2,005,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $943,000, NON-CASH EXPENSES FOR  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF $436,000, AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OF $483,000, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY A NON-CASH BENEFIT TO DEFERRED  TAXES OF $384,000 RELATED TO THE NEWLY ENACTED TAX REFORM ACT, IN ADDITION TO CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PROVIDING  CASH. CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PROVIDING CASH INCLUDE DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES OF $1,667,000  AND $313,000, RESPECTIVELY. DAY\\u2019S SALES OUTSTANDING DECREASED SIX DAYS TO 30 DAYS FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 TO DECEMBER 31,  2017. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY REPRESENTS AN ADJUSTMENT FOR SEASONAL DEMAND ALONG WITH CHANGES IN STOCKING LEVELS. CHANGES IN  WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS USING CASH INCLUDE A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND DEFERRED RENT OF $1,498,000 WHICH  PRIMARILY REFLECTS FISCAL 2017 ACCRUED BONUS COMPENSATION ACCRUALS PAID IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS  AND BANK CDS IN DENOMINATIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS BANKS. WE BELIEVE WE OBTAIN A COMPETITIVE RATE OF RETURN GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE  ALONG WITH THE SECURITY PROVIDED BY THE FDIC ON THESE INVESTMENTS. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE USED CASH  TO PURCHASE $1,558,000 OF FDIC-BACKED SECURITIES AND RECEIVED $1,680,000 ON CDS THAT MATURED. PURCHASES OF PATENTS AND CAPITAL  EQUIPMENT, MAINLY RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT, CONSUMED $277,000 OF CASH.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017,  WE USED CASH TO PURCHASE $2,466,000 OF FDIC-BACKED SECURITIES AND RECEIVED $2,477,000 ON CDS THAT MATURED. PURCHASES OF PATENTS  AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, MAINLY RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT, CONSUMED $230,000 OF CASH.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018,  WE RECEIVED $146,000 FROM EMPLOYEES\\u2019 PARTICIPATION AND PURCHASE OF STOCK THROUGH OUR ESPP AND USED $7,000 TO PAY FOR TAXES  AS A RESULT OF EMPLOYEES\\u2019 VESTING OF RESTRICTED SHARES USING SHARE WITHHOLDING.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE RECEIVED $148,000 FROM EMPLOYEES\\u2019 PARTICIPATION AND PURCHASE OF STOCK THROUGH OUR ESPP AND USED  $9,000 TO PAY FOR TAXES AS A RESULT OF EMPLOYEES\\u2019 EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS AND VESTING OF RESTRICTED SHARES USING SHARE  WITHHOLDING. ADDITIONALLY, WE USED $11,000 TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  AS  OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAD AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY $7,159,000 IN ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED  ON NOVEMBER 13, 2014 THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASED ON APRIL 25, 2017.  13  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT UTILIZES ITS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE,  CUMULATIVE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE, JUDGMENT AND OTHER FACTORS IN THE SELECTION AND APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE  THEY REQUIRE THE MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, STOCK BASED COMPENSATION, DEFERRED  TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES, ACCRUALS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN ITEM  7. \\u201cMANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\u201d OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THERETO AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q.  ALL REFERENCES HEREIN TO THE TERM \\u201cFISCAL YEAR\\u201d SHALL MEAN A YEAR ENDED MARCH 31 OF THE YEAR SPECIFIED.  WESTELL TECHNOLOGIES, INC., (THE COMPANY) IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION AND DIFFERENTIATION AT THE EDGE OF COMMUNICATION NETWORKS WHERE END USERS CONNECT.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS ENABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND NETWORK OPERATORS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE OPERATING EXPENSES.  WITH MILLIONS OF PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED WORLDWIDE, WESTELL IS A TRUSTED PARTNER FOR TRANSFORMING NETWORKS INTO HIGH-QUALITY, RELIABLE SYSTEMS.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S  THREE  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  IN-BUILDING WIRELESS (IBW) SEGMENT  IBW SEGMENT SOLUTIONS ENABLE CELLULAR COVERAGE IN STADIUMS, ARENAS, MALLS, BUILDINGS, AND OTHER INDOOR AREAS NOT SERVED WELL OR AT ALL BY THE EXISTING \\\"MACRO\\\" OUTDOOR CELLULAR NETWORK.  FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICE, SOLUTIONS INCLUDE DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEMS (DAS) CONDITIONERS AND DIGITAL REPEATERS.  FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY MARKET, SOLUTIONS INCLUDE HALF-WATT AND TWO-WATT REPEATERS AND A BATTERY BACKUP UNIT.  IBW ALSO OFFERS ANCILLARY PRODUCTS THAT CONSIST OF PASSIVE SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND ANTENNAS FOR BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC SAFETY MARKETS.  INTELLIGENT SITE MANAGEMENT (ISM) SEGMENT (FORMERLY INTELLIGENT SITE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES OR ISMS)  ISM SEGMENT SOLUTIONS INCLUDE A SUITE OF REMOTE UNITS, WHICH ARE NETWORK DEVICES USED FOR ON-SITE PROCESSING.  REMOTES PROVIDE ON-SITE MACHINE-TO-MACHINE (M2M) COMMUNICATIONS THAT ENABLE OPERATORS TO REMOTELY MONITOR, MANAGE, AND CONTROL SITE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS.  REMOTES CAN BE AND OFTEN ARE COMBINED WITH OUR OPTIMA MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEM.  ISM ALSO OFFERS SUPPORT SERVICES (I.E., MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS) AND DEPLOYMENT SERVICES (I.E., INSTALLATION).  COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK SOLUTIONS (CNS) SEGMENT  CNS SEGMENT SOLUTIONS INCLUDE A BROAD RANGE OF OUTDOOR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE OFFERINGS CONSISTING OF INTEGRATED CABINETS, POWER DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTS, COPPER AND FIBER CONNECTIVITY PANELS, FIBER ACCESS PRODUCTS, T1 NETWORK INTERFACE UNITS (NIUS), AND TOWER MOUNTED AMPLIFIERS (TMAS).  CUSTOMERS  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CUSTOMER BASE INCLUDES COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS, NEUTRAL-HOST OPERATORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS.  DUE TO THE STRINGENT CUSTOMER QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS AND REGULATED ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH MANY CUSTOMERS  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATE, THE COMPANY MUST UNDERGO LENGTHY APPROVAL AND PROCUREMENT PROCESSES PRIOR TO SELLING MOST OF ITS PRODUCTS.  ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT UP-FRONT INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCT AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO ACTUAL COMMENCEMENT OF SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS.  THE PRICES FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VARY BASED UPON VOLUME, CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS, AND OTHER CRITERIA, AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING COST AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS.  TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND/OR IN TARGETED SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCT LINES AND FEATURES.  FAILURE TO INCREASE REVENUES FROM NEW PRODUCTS, WHETHER DUE TO LACK OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, COMPETITION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, PURCHASING DECISIONS, MEETING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS, OR OTHERWISE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES AND INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  IN VIEW OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S RELIANCE ON THE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET FOR REVENUES, THE PROJECT NATURE OF THE BUSINESS, THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF ORDERS, AND PRICING PRESSURES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN CUSTOMER ORDERING AND PURCHASING ACTIVITY DUE PRIMARILY TO THE PROJECT-BASED NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND DUE TO BUDGETING AND PROCUREMENT PATTERNS TOWARD THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR OR THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CALENDAR YEAR.  WHILE THESE FACTORS CAN RESULT IN THE GREATEST FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S THIRD AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS, THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT AND MAY NOT ALWAYS CORRELATE TO FINANCIAL RESULTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  BELOW IS A TABLE THAT COMPARES REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  , AND  2017  , BY SEGMENT.  REVENUE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  CHANGE  2018  2017  CHANGE  IBW  $2,794  $5,223  $(2,429  )  $9,997  $20,098  $(10,101  )  ISM  5,116  5,802  (686  )  13,506  14,662  (1,156  )  CNS  2,812  2,650  162  10,362  12,721  (2,359  )  CONSOLIDATED REVENUE  $10,722  $13,675  $(2,953  )  $33,865  $47,481  $(13,616  )  IBW REVENUE WAS  $2.8 MILLION  AND  $10.0 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $5.2 MILLION  AND  $20.1 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR BOTH PERIODS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES OF DAS CONDITIONERS, COMMERCIAL REPEATERS, AND ANCILLARY PRODUCTS.  SALES OF DAS CONDITIONERS HAVE DECREASED DUE TO A NETWORK ARCHITECTURE SHIFT TO AN ALTERNATIVE, NON-DAS SOLUTION FOR IN-BUILDING COVERAGE IN LARGE VENUES SUCH AS STADIUMS AND ARENAS.  GOING FORWARD, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE SALES OF DAS CONDITIONERS TO REBOUND TO PREVIOUS LEVELS, BUT WE DO EXPECT ON-GOING DEMAND WHERE CUSTOMERS MAY ADD CAPACITY TO THE EXISTING EMBEDDED BASE OF LARGE-VENUE DAS NETWORKS, AS WELL AS IN SMALLER IN-BUILDING DAS DEPLOYMENTS THAT REQUIRE A STAND-ALONE CONDITIONER.  WHILE WE EXPECT THE COMMERCIAL REPEATER MARKET TO EITHER REMAIN FLAT OR DECLINE FURTHER, AS CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO SHIFT TO OTHER FORMS OF COMMERCIAL IN-BUILDING COVERAGE SUCH AS SMALL CELLS, WE EXPECT THE MARKET FOR PUBLIC SAFETY REPEATERS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS MORE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES PASS AND ENFORCE ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE IN-BUILDING CELLULAR COMMUNICATION COVERAGE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.  ISM REVENUE WAS  $5.1 MILLION  AND  $13.5 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $5.8 MILLION  AND  $14.7 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR BOTH PERIODS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN SERVICES REVENUE, WHICH WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN BOTH DEPLOYMENT AND SUPPORT SERVICE REVENUE FROM ONE MAJOR DOMESTIC CUSTOMER.  THE SERVICES REVENUE DECLINE WAS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRODUCT REVENUE.  DUE TO THE PROJECT-BASED NATURE OF OUR ISM BUSINESS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON FUTURE TRENDS.  CNS REVENUE WAS  $2.8 MILLION  AND  $10.4 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $2.7 MILLION  AND  $12.7 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES OF INTEGRATED CABINETS AND COPPER/FIBER NETWORK CONNECTIVITY PANELS AS WELL AS REVENUE FROM OUR FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS INTRODUCED EARLIER THIS YEAR, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF POWER DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTS, T1 NIUS, AND TMAS.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER SALES OF INTEGRATED CABINETS, T1 NIUS, AND TMAS, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES OF COPPER/FIBER NETWORK CONNECTIVITY PANELS AND OUR NEW FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS.  WE EXPECT REVENUE FROM OUR NEW FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS TO GROW.  WE EXPECT SALES OF INTEGRATED CABINETS, WHICH ARE HEAVILY PROJECT-BASED, TO REMAIN UNEVEN, WHILE SALES OF POWER DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTS AND COPPER/FIBER CONNECTIVITY PANELS ARE EXPECTED TO AT LEAST REMAIN STEADY.  WE EXPECT T1 NIUS AND TMA REVENUE TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE OVER TIME AS THESE PRODUCTS ARE IN DECLINING MARKETS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS MARGIN  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  2017  CHANGE  2018  2017  CHANGE  IBW  38.3%  47.3%  (9.0  )%  44.2%  45.4%  (1.2  )%  ISM  56.7%  54.5%  2.2%  53.8%  51.2%  2.6%  CNS  22.1%  16.9%  5.2%  29.2%  27.4%  1.8%  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN  42.8%  44.4%  (1.6  )%  43.5%  42.4%  1.1%  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN CHANGES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD ARE A FUNCTION OF THE REVENUE MIX AMONG THE THREE SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS MARGIN CHANGES WITHIN EACH OF THE SEGMENTS WHICH ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER MIX, REVENUE LEVELS, PRICES, AND COSTS.  THE SLIGHT YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LOWER MARGIN WITH THE IBW SEGMENT DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER IBW SEGMENT REVENUE, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE HIGHER MARGIN ISM SEGMENT REPRESENTING A GREAT PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL REVENUE MIX.  THE SLIGHT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER MARGIN ISM SEGMENT REPRESENTING A GREAT PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL REVENUE MIX.

THE INCREASE IN THE COMPARABLE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE SPENDING IN THE NEW FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS IN THE CNS SEGMENT. THE DECREASE IN THE COMPARABLE NINE MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IBW SEGMENT, WHERE THE BUSINESS SHIFTED ITS FOCUS TO PURSUE GROWTH VIA OEM PARTNERSHIPS RATHER THAN DEVELOPING PRODUCTS INTERNALLY.  THIS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A CNS INCREASE RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEW FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE DECREASED  $0.3 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER EXPENSE STRUCTURE AS A PART OF THE COMPANY'S AFOREMENTIONED OVERALL RESETTING OF COST AND EXPENSE.

THE INCREASE IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EXTERNAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN THE NINE MONTH PERIOD WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER EXPENSE STRUCTURE AS A PART OF THE COMPANY'S AFOREMENTIONED OVERALL RESETTING OF COST AND EXPENSE.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  CHANGE  2018  2017  CHANGE  CONSOLIDATED INTANGIBLE  AMORTIZATION  $830  $1,047  $(217  )  $2,652  $3,142  $(490  )  AMORTIZATION IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND DECEMBER 31, 2017 WERE NON-CASH EXPENSES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ESTABLISHED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS WITHIN ALL THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS DURING THE 2012 TO 2014 TIME FRAMES.  THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, TRADE NAMES, AND BACKLOG DERIVED FROM THE ACQUISITIONS.  THE DECREASE IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER RELATED INTANGIBLES FROM THE ANTONE ACQUISITION BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED.

DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-RECURRING FOREIGN CURRENCY GAIN OF $0.6 MILLION RELATED TO THE WIND-DOWN OF THE NORANTEL LEGAL ENTITY.  THE DECREASE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET DUE TO INCREASED INTEREST RATES ON INVESTMENTS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \\u201cACT\\u201d).  THE ACT SIGNIFICANTLY REVISES THE FUTURE ONGOING U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING THE U.S. CORPORATE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM  34%  TO  21%  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  THE FINAL TRANSITION IMPACTS OF THE ACT MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATES, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN INTERPRETATIONS OF THE ACT, ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS THAT ARISE BECAUSE OF THE ACT, ANY CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR INCOME TAXES OR RELATED INTERPRETATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE ACT, OR ANY UPDATES OR CHANGES TO ESTIMATES THE COMPANY HAS UTILIZED TO CALCULATE THE TRANSITION IMPACTS, INCLUDING IMPACTS FROM CHANGES TO CURRENT YEAR EARNINGS ESTIMATES.  THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ALLOWS FOR A MEASUREMENT PERIOD OF UP TO ONE YEAR AFTER THE ENACTMENT DATE OF THE ACT TO FINALIZE THE RECORDING OF THE RELATED TAX IMPACTS.  IN THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY HAS FINALIZED ITS ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT WITH NO MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY HAS  $697,000  OF FEDERAL ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX (\\\"AMT\\\")  CREDIT CARRYFORWARD.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMOUNT BY  2022  VIA A TAX REFUND.  THE COMPANY RECORDED  $1,000  AND  $11,000  OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, USING AN EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF  (0.32)%  PLUS DISCRETE ITEMS.  THE COMPANY RECORDED  $685,000  AND  $660,000  OF INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  , USING AN EFFECTIVE RATE OF  1.76%  PLUS DISCRETE ITEMS.  THE EFFECTIVE RATE IN BOTH PERIODS IS IMPACTED BY THE INTRAPERIOD ALLOCATION AS A RESULT OF INCOME OR LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, AND STATES WHICH BASE TAX ON GROSS MARGIN AND NOT PRETAX INCOME.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN EXPENSE OF  $0.1 MILLION  FOR LOSS CONTINGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH TWO INDEMNITY CLAIMS RELATED TO A SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER CONTRACT.  BOTH OF THESE CLAIMS RELATE TO A BUSINESS WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY SOLD AND THEREFORE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE RANGE OF THE COMBINED PROBABLE LOSSES TO BE $0.1 MILLION TO $0.5 MILLION.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET INCOME (LOSS)  NET LOSS WAS  $1.6 MILLION  AND  $3.3 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  NET INCOME WAS  $0.8 MILLION  AND  $0.9 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  .  THE CHANGES WERE A RESULT OF THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THE VARIANCES IDENTIFIED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD  $27.1 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTING OF BANK DEPOSITS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL SATISFY CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CASH FLOWS  THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $638  $5,069  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  2,506  (4,798  )  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1,038  )  (558  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE ON CHANGES ON CASH  (4  )  1  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $2,102  $(286  )  NET CASH  PROVIDED  BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.6 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $5.1 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE CHANGE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE NET LOSS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS AND AN INCREASE IN CASH USED BY WORKING CAPITAL WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET CASH  PROVIDED  BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $2.5 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $4.8 MILLION  USED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONVERSION OF ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS INTO CASH EQUIVALENTS.  NET CASH  USED  BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.0 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $0.6 MILLION  USED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASED USE OF CASH WAS DUE PRIMARILY FROM THE INCREASED PURCHASES OF TREASURY STOCK.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY  $37.0 MILLION  BEFORE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF  $37.0 MILLION  .  ALSO, AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD A $3.0 MILLION TAX CONTINGENCY RESERVE RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, WHICH IS OFFSET AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  THE FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD BEGINS TO EXPIRE IN FISCAL YEAR 2023.  REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\\u2019S FUTURE DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS IS DEPENDENT UPON GENERATING SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME PRIOR TO THEIR EXPIRATION, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  THE COMPANY WEIGHED POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND WHETHER A TAX BENEFIT SHOULD BE RECORDED WHEN TAXABLE LOSSES ARE INCURRED.  THE EXISTENCE OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE DOES NOT LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF TAX ASSETS TO REDUCE TAXES PAYABLE WHEN TAXABLE INCOME ARISES.  MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND MAY ADJUST THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ACCORDINGLY.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS A  50%  EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN ACCESSTEL KENTROX AUSTRALIA PTY LTD (AKA).  AKA DISTRIBUTES NETWORK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER  50%  OWNER TO ONE CUSTOMER.  THE COMPANY HOLDS EQUAL VOTING CONTROL WITH THE OTHER OWNER.  ALL ACTIONS OF AKA ARE DECIDED AT THE BOARD LEVEL BY MAJORITY VOTE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS PROVIDED AN UNLIMITED GUARANTEE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OTHER 50% OWNER IN AKA, WHICH PRIMARILY PROVIDES SUPPORT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER.  THIS GUARANTEE WAS PUT IN PLACE AT THE REQUEST OF THE AKA CUSTOMER.  THE GUARANTEE,  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE A MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENT OF  $0.7 MILLION  , WILL STAY IN PLACE AS LONG AS THE CONTRACT BETWEEN AKA AND THE CUSTOMER IS IN PLACE.  THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE RECOURSE AGAINST THE OTHER 50% OWNER IN AKA IN THE EVENT THE GUARANTEE IS TRIGGERED.  THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT COULD PERFORM ON THE OBLIGATION IT GUARANTEED AT A POSITIVE RATE OF RETURN AND, THEREFORE, DID NOT ASSIGN VALUE TO THE GUARANTEE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS DISCUSSED IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUE  THE COMPANY RECORDS REVENUE BASED ON A FIVE-STEP MODEL IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606.  THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES IDENTIFIED IN CONTRACTS.  A CONTRACT EXISTS WHEN BOTH PARTIES HAVE AN APPROVED AGREEMENT THAT CREATES ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, IDENTIFIES PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND PAYMENT TERMS AND HAS COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE.  THE COMPANY RECORDS REVENUE FROM THESE CONTRACTS WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TRANSFER TO THE CUSTOMER.  THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IS BASED UPON THE CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF ANY VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S REVENUE IS RECORDED AT A POINT IN TIME FROM THE SALE OF TANGIBLE PRODUCTS.  REVENUE IS RECORDED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, DEPENDENT UPON THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACT.  FOR RIGHT-TO-USE SOFTWARE, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME THE CUSTOMER HAS THE RIGHT TO USE AND CAN SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFIT FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE.  PRODUCTS REGULARLY INCLUDE WARRANTIES THAT INCLUDE BUG FIXES, AND MINOR UPDATES SO THAT THE PRODUCT CONTINUES TO FUNCTION AS PROMISED IN A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT, AND PHONE SUPPORT.  THESE STANDARD WARRANTIES ARE ASSURANCE TYPE WARRANTIES WHICH DO NOT OFFER ANY SERVICES BEYOND THE ASSURANCE THAT THE PRODUCT WILL CONTINUE WORKING AS SPECIFIED.  THEREFORE, WARRANTIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  INSTEAD, THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE EXPECTED COST OF WARRANTY.  EXTENDED WARRANTIES ARE SOLD SEPARATELY WITH A POST CONTRACT SUPPORT (PCS) AGREEMENT.  PCS REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME DURING THE SUPPORT PERIOD.  REVENUE FROM INSTALLATION SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED OR TRANSFERRED AS THIS IS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS OBTAINED CONTROL.  THE COMPANY HAS CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  WHEN THE SALES AGREEMENT INVOLVES MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, EACH OBLIGATION IS SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED AND THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING THE PROMISED GOOD OR SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  IN MOST CASES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES THE CONSIDERATION TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE (RSP) OF THE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE RSP IS NOT OBSERVABLE, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS BY UTILIZING THE RESIDUAL APPROACH.  FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT THE COMPANY SATISFIES OVER TIME, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BY CONSISTENTLY APPLYING A METHOD OF MEASURING PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETE SATISFACTION OF THAT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE METHOD THAT MOST ACCURATELY DEPICTS THE PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  IF THE MEASURE OF REMAINING RIGHTS EXCEEDS THE MEASURE OF THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A CONTRACT ASSET.  CONVERSELY, IF THE MEASURE OF THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDS THE MEASURE OF THE REMAINING RIGHTS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A CONTRACT LIABILITY.  CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO PRODUCT RETURNS WILL BE RECORDED AS CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND PRESENTED ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND DEFERRED REVENUE, RESPECTIVELY.  CUSTOMER BILLINGS FOR SERVICES NOT YET RENDERED ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AS THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED.  THE ASSOCIATED DEFERRED REVENUE IS INCLUDED IN DEFERRED REVENUE OR DEFERRED REVENUE NON-CURRENT, AS APPROPRIATE, IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"WESTELL TECHNOLOGIES INC\", \"CIK\": 1002135, \"Date\": \"2019-02-08T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"WSTL\", \"Name\": \"Westell Technologies Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 3661.0, \"Business\": \"IL\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 363154957.0, \"key\": \"20190208WSTL\", \"labelr1\": 0.4694835680751282, \"labelr2\": -1.4018691588785164, \"labelr3\": 1.8957345971563997, \"labelr4\": -2.3255813953488293, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.62707675, \"prof1\": 0.37292328, \"return1&2\": 1.0092580404545657, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9901251866070856, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.0131513537374828, \"return2\": 1.0140186915887852, \"return1\": 0.9953051643192488, \"return3\": 0.9810426540284359, \"return4\": 1.0232558139534882, \"1_day_return\": 0.4694835680751242, \"cumulative_return1\": 1.6006309864754622, \"cumulative_return1&2\": 1.2172929722409735, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": 0.6882500167364497, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.5643093674881092, \"indexx\": 115, \"returnpred\": -0.4694835680751282, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9974535273092209, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.0119455290735977, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9494881403230302, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0012081964600288, \"cumreturnsp500\": 0.9995698493038732}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 122, \"level_0\": 124, \"index\": 39666, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

BROMPHENIRAMINE/PSEUDOEPHEDRINE  IMMEDIATE RELEASE CAPSULES  ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2011,  THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH ECR PHARMACEUTICALS (\\u201cECR\\u201d), LAUNCHED BROM/PSEUD CAPSULES UNDER THE BRAND NAME, LODRANE D\\u00ae,  AN IMMEDIATE RELEASE FORMULATION OF BROMPHENIRAMINE MALEATE AND PSEUDOEPHEDRINE HCL, AN EFFECTIVE, LOW-SEDATING ANTIHISTAMINE  COMBINED WITH A DECONGESTANT.  BROM/PSEUD CAPSULES  ARE MARKETED UNDER THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MONOGRAPH (THE \\u201cOTC MONOGRAPH\\u201d) AND ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE CODE OF FEDERAL  REGULATIONS CAN BE LAWFULLY MARKETED IN THE US WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE FDA. WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE FDA HAS REVISED  ITS ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THESE UNAPPROVED PRODUCTS MAY BE MARKETED. IF THE  FDA DETERMINES THAT A COMPANY IS DISTRIBUTING AN UNAPPROVED PRODUCT THAT REQUIRES APPROVAL, THE FDA MAY TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION  IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PRODUCT SEIZURES AND SEEKING A JUDICIAL INJUNCTION AGAINST DISTRIBUTION.  ELITE MANUFACTURES  THIS PRODUCT, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MERGERS AND SUCCESSOR ENTITIES EFFECTING THE MARKETING OF THIS PRODUCT AND TRANSFER  OF BRAND NAME OWNERSHIP SINCE THIS PRODUCT WAS ORIGINALLY LAUNCHED. MARKETING OF THIS PRODUCT UNDER THE LODRANE D\\u00ae WAS LAST  CONDUCTED BY VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS INTERNATIONAL INC.

SEQUESTOXTM IS AN IMMEDIATE-RELEASE OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE CONTAINING SEQUESTERED NALTREXONE WHICH INCORPORATES 5MG, 10MG,  15MG, 20MG AND 30MG DOSES OF OXYCODONE INTO CAPSULES.  IN JANUARY 2016, THE  COMPANY SUBMITTED A 505(B)(2) NEW DRUG APPLICATION FOR SEQUESTOXTM, AFTER RECEIVING A WAIVER OF THE $2.3 MILLION FILING FEE  FROM THE FDA. IN MARCH 2016, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF THE FDA\\u2019S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS FILING AND THAT SUCH FILING  HAS BEEN GRANTED PRIORITY REVIEW BY THE FDA WITH A TARGET ACTION UNDER THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT (\\u201cPDUFA\\u201d)  OF JULY 14, 2016.  ON JULY 15, 2016,  THE FDA ISSUED A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER, OR CRL, REGARDING THE NDA. THE CRL STATED THAT THE REVIEW CYCLE FOR THE SEQUESTOXTM  NDA IS COMPLETE AND THE APPLICATION IS NOT READY FOR APPROVAL IN ITS PRESENT FORM.  ON DECEMBER 21, 2016,  THE COMPANY MET WITH THE FDA FOR AN END-OF-REVIEW MEETING TO DISCUSS STEPS THAT IT COULD TAKE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL OF SEQUESTOXTM.  BASED ON THIS AND THE MEETING MINUTES RECEIVED FROM THE FDA ON JANUARY 23, 2017, THE COMPANY FORMULATED A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE  ISSUES CITED BY THE FDA IN THE CRL, WITH SUCH PLAN INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, MODIFYING THE SEQUESTOXTM FORMULATION,  CONDUCTING BIOEQUIVALENCE AND BIOAVAILABILITY FED AND FASTED STUDIES, COMPARING THE MODIFIED FORMULATION TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION.  ON JULY 7, 2017, THE  COMPANY REPORTED TOPLINE RESULTS FROM A PIVOTAL BIOEQUIVALENCE FED STUDY FOR OR SEQUESTOXTM. THE MEAN TMAX (THE AMOUNT OF  TIME THAT A DRUG IS PRESENT AT THE MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION IN SERUM) OF SEQUESTOXTM WAS 4.6 HOURS WITH A RANGE OF 0.5  HOUR TO 12 HOURS AND THE MEAN TMAX OF THE COMPARATOR, ROXICODONE\\u00ae, WAS 3.4 HOURS WITH A RANGE OF 0.5 HOUR TO 12 HOURS. A KEY  OBJECTIVE FOR THE STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF THE REFORMULATED SEQUESTOXTM HAD A SIMILAR TMAX TO THE COMPARATOR WHEN TAKEN  WITH A HIGH FAT MEAL. ELITE WILL PAUSE, NOT PROCEED WITH THE REST OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS, AND SEEK CLARITY FROM FDA BEFORE DECIDING  ON THE NEXT STEPS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE SEQUESTOXTM. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE EXTENDED RELEASE PRODUCTS WITH ITS  PROPRIETARY ABUSE DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY.  ON JANUARY 30, 2018,  THE COMPANY REPORTED POSITIVE TOPLINE RESULTS FROM A PILOT STUDY CONDUCTED FOR SEQUESTOXTM. AN OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS  TO ASSESS WHETHER THE REFORMULATED SEQUESTOX COULD ACHIEVE A TMAX COMPARABLE TO THE REFERENCE DRUG, ROXICODONE, WHEN DOSED WITH  THE STANDARD HIGH FAT MEAL SPECIFIED BY FDA. AS OPPOSED TO THE EARLIER FORMULATION, BASED ON THESE PILOT RESULTS, THE MODIFIED  SEQUESTOXTM IS EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE BIOEQUIVALENCE WITH A TMAX RANGE EQUIVALENT TO THE REFERENCE PRODUCT WHEN CONDUCTED IN  A PIVOTAL TRIAL UNDER FED CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED  THE PILOT DATA TO THE FDA, REQUESTING CLARIFICATION AS TO REQUIREMENTS FOR RESUBMISSION OF THE NDA. THE FDA HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE  FOR REPEATED BIO-EQUIVALENCE STUDIES IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THE NEW FORMULATION TO THE ORIGINAL SEQUESTOX STUDIES, AND ALSO EXTENDED  OUR FILING FEE WAIVER UNTIL DECEMBER 2019.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES  OF THE SUCCESS OF ANY FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS, OR IF SUCH TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT AN INTENDED FUTURE  RESUBMISSION OF THE NDA PRODUCT FILING, IF MADE, WILL BE ACCEPTED BY OR RECEIVE MARKETING APPROVAL FROM THE FDA, AND ACCORDINGLY,  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL EARN AND RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL $7.5 MILLION OR FUTURE LICENSE FEES (SEE \\u201c  LICENSING,  MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS; SALES AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH EPIC PHARMA LLC FOR SEQUESTOXTM  \\u201d  BELOW). IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECEIVE THESE PAYMENTS OR FEES, IT WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN ADDITION, EVEN IF MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IS RECEIVED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE FUTURE REVENUES OR PROFITS,  OR THAT ANY SUCH FUTURE REVENUES OR PROFITS WOULD BE IN AMOUNTS THAT PROVIDE ADEQUATE RETURN ON THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS MADE  TO SECURE THIS MARKETING AUTHORIZATION.

AS OF THE DATE OF FILING OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED $7.5 MILLION  OF THE $15 MILLION IN NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS DUE PURSUANT TO THE 2015 SEQUESTOXTM LICENSE AGREEMENT, WITH SUCH AMOUNT CONSISTING  OF $5 MILLION BEING DUE AND OWING ON THE EXECUTION DATE OF THE 2015 SEQUESTOXTM LICENSE AGREEMENT, AND $2.5 MILLION BEING  EARNED AS OF JANUARY 14, 2016, THE DATE OF ELITE\\u2019S FILING OF AN NDA WITH THE FDA FOR THE RELEVANT PRODUCT.

PLEASE NOTE THAT ON  JULY 15, 2016, THE FDA ISSUED A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER, OR CRL, REGARDING THE NDA. THE CRL STATED THAT THE REVIEW CYCLE FOR  THE SEQUESTOXTM NDA IS COMPLETE AND THE APPLICATION IS NOT READY FOR APPROVAL IN ITS PRESENT FORM. BASED ON SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS  AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE FDA, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A CLEAR PATH FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES CITED IN THE CRL.

STRATEGIC MARKETING  ALLIANCE WITH GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. USA  ON MAY 29, 2018, WE  ENTERED INTO A LICENSE, MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC. USA (\\u201cGLENMARK\\u201d) TO  MARKET THE TWO ELITE GENERIC PRODUCTS DESCRIBED BELOW IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THE OPTION TO ADD PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE (THE  \\u201cGLENMARK ALLIANCE\\u201d).  PURSUANT TO THE GLENMARK  ALLIANCE, GLENMARK WILL PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS FROM ELITE AND THEN SELL AND DISTRIBUTE THEM. IN ADDITION TO THE PURCHASE PRICES  FOR THE PRODUCTS, ELITE WILL RECEIVE LICENSE FEES WELL IN EXCESS OF 50% OF GROSS PROFITS. GROSS PROFITS ARE DEFINED AS NET SALES  LESS THE PRICE PAID TO ELITE FOR THE PRODUCTS, DISTRIBUTION FEES (LESS THAN 10%) AND SHIPPING COSTS. GLENMARK WILL HAVE SEMI-EXCLUSIVE  MARKETING RIGHTS TO THE ANDA APPROVED GENERIC PRODUCT, PHENDIMETRAZINE 35MG TABLETS, AND EXCLUSIVE MARKETING RIGHTS TO METHADONE  5MG AND 10MG, PRODUCTS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE FDA ON AUGUST 3, 2018. COLLECTIVELY, THE BRAND PRODUCTS AND THEIR GENERIC EQUIVALENTS  HAD TOTAL ANNUAL SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $33.6 MILLION IN 2017, ACCORDING TO QUINTILES IMS HEALTH DATA. THE AGREEMENT HAS AN INITIAL  TERM OF THREE YEARS AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS FOR ONE-YEAR PERIODS ABSENT PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE OF NON-RENEWAL. IN ADDITION TO CUSTOMARY  TERMINATION PROVISIONS, THE AGREEMENT PERMITS GLENMARK TO TERMINATE WITH REGARD TO A PRODUCT ON AT LEAST THREE MONTHS\\u2019 PRIOR  WRITTEN NOTICE IF IT DETERMINES TO STOP MARKETING AND SELLING SUCH PRODUCT, AND IT PERMITS ELITE TO TERMINATE WITH REGARD TO A  PRODUCT IF AT ANY TIME AFTER THE FIRST TWELVEMONTHS FROM THE FIRST COMMERCIAL SALE, THE AVERAGE LICENSE FEE PAID BY GLENMARK FOR  SUCH PRODUCT IS LESS THAN A DEFINED MINIMUM AMOUNT.  PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT  ELITE\\u2019S RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING ITS PROPRIETARY ABUSE DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE DEVELOPMENT  OF A RANGE OF ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOID PRODUCTS THAT UTILIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER APPROACHES TO ABUSE DETERRENCE.  ELITE\\u2019S PROPRIETARY  ABUSE-DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY UTILIZES THE PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH TO ABUSE DETERRENCE AND CONSISTS OF A MULTI-PARTICULATE CAPSULE  WHICH CONTAINS AN OPIOID AGONIST IN ADDITION TO NALTREXONE, AN OPIOID ANTAGONIST USED PRIMARILY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE  AND OPIOID DEPENDENCE. WHEN THIS PRODUCT IS TAKEN AS INTENDED, THE NALTREXONE IS DESIGNED TO PASS THROUGH THE BODY UNRELEASED  WHILE THE OPIOID AGONIST RELEASES OVER TIME PROVIDING THERAPEUTIC PAIN RELIEF FOR WHICH IT IS PRESCRIBED. IF THE MULTI-PARTICULATE  BEADS ARE CRUSHED OR DISSOLVED, THE OPIOID ANTAGONIST, NALTREXONE, IS DESIGNED TO RELEASE. THE ABSORPTION OF THE NALTREXONE IS  INTENDED TO BLOCK THE EUPHORIA BY PREFERENTIALLY BINDING TO SAME RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN AS THE OPIOID AGONIST AND THEREBY REDUCING  THE INCENTIVE FOR ABUSE OR MISUSE BY RECREATIONAL DRUG ABUSERS.  WE FILED AN NDA FOR  THE FIRST PRODUCT TO UTILIZE OUR ABUSE DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY, IMMEDIATE RELEASE OXYCODONE 5MG, 10MG, 15MG, 20MG AND 30MG WITH SEQUESTERED  NALTREXONE (COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY REFERRED TO AS \\u201cSEQUESTOXTM\\u201d), ON JANUARY 14, 2016.

AN ADDITIONAL $7.5 MILLION NON-REFUNDABLE MILESTONE IS DUE UPON THE FDA\\u2019S APPROVAL OF ELITE\\u2019S NDA. PLEASE  NOTE, AS FURTHER DETAILED ABOVE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES OF THE COMPANY RECEIVING MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR SEQUESTOXTM,  AND ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL EARN AND RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL $7.5 MILLION OR FUTURE LICENSE  FEES. THE NON-RECEIPT BY THE COMPANY OF THESE PAYMENTS AND OR FEES WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  PLEASE NOTE THAT,  WHILE THE FDA IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS WITHIN CERTAIN TIMEFRAMES, DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS, THE FDA FREQUENTLY REQUESTS  THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BE SUBMITTED. THE EFFECT OF SUCH REQUEST AND SUBSEQUENT SUBMISSION CAN SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND THE TIME  FOR THE NDA REVIEW PROCESS. UNTIL AN NDA IS ACTUALLY APPROVED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE INFORMATION REQUESTED AND SUBMITTED  WILL BE CONSIDERED ADEQUATE BY THE FDA TO JUSTIFY APPROVAL. THE PACKAGING AND LABELING OF OUR DEVELOPED PRODUCTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT  TO FDA REGULATION. BASED ON THE FOREGOING, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ANTICIPATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO OBTAIN FDA  APPROVAL TO MARKET ANY PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES OF THE COMPANY FILING THE REQUIRED APPLICATION(S) WITH  THE FDA OR OF THE FDA APPROVING SUCH APPLICATION(S) IF FILED, AND THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE  PRODUCTS INCORPORATING ITS ABUSE DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY IS SUBJECT TO A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK AS DETAILED IN \\u201cITEM 1A-RISK FACTORS-RISKS  RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\\u201d OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FILED WITH THE SEC ON JUNE 14, 2018.  ABUSE-DETERRENT AND SUSTAINED RELEASE  OPIOIDS  THE ABUSE-DETERRENT  OPIOID PRODUCTS UTILIZE OUR PATENTED ABUSE-DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BASED ON A PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH. THESE PRODUCTS ARE  COMBINATIONS OF A NARCOTIC AGONIST FORMULATION INTENDED FOR USE IN PATIENTS WITH PAIN, AND AN ANTAGONIST, FORMULATED TO DETER  ABUSE OF THE DRUG. BOTH, AGONIST AND ANTAGONIST, HAVE BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND SOLD SEPARATELY IN VARIOUS  DOSE STRENGTHS. WE HAVE FILED INDS FOR TWO ABUSE RESISTANT PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND HAVE TESTED PRODUCTS IN VARIOUS PHARMACOKINETIC  AND EFFICACY STUDIES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP MULTIPLE ABUSE RESISTANT PRODUCTS. PRODUCTS UTILIZING THE PHARMACOLOGICAL  APPROACH TO DETER ABUSE SUCH AS SUBOXONE\\u00ae, A PRODUCT MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES BY RECKITT BENCKISER PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.,  AND EMBEDA\\u00ae, A PRODUCT MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES BY PFIZER, INC., HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA AND ARE BEING MARKETED  IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE DEVELOPED, LICENSED TO EPIC THE MARKETING RIGHTS TO SEQUESTOXTM, IMMEDIATE RELEASE OXYCODONE  WITH NALTREXONE, AND RETAIN THE RIGHTS TO THE REMAINDER OF THESE ABUSE RESISTANT AND SUSTAINED RELEASE OPIOID PRODUCTS. WE MAY  LICENSE THESE PRODUCTS AT A LATER DATE TO A THIRD PARTY WHO COULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE REMAINING CLINICAL STUDIES AND WHO COULD  PROVIDE SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FOR THE PRODUCT.  WE ALSO DEVELOPED  CONTROLLED RELEASE TECHNOLOGY FOR OXYCODONE UNDER A JOINT VENTURE WITH ELAN WHICH TERMINATED IN 2002.

MANUFACTURING FEES  INCREASED BY $0.02 MILLION, OR 1%, DUE TO THE METHADONE LAUNCH, AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED ABOVE.  LICENSING FEES INCREASED  BY $0.1 MILLION, OR 30%. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF IN-MARKET SALES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S GENERIC PRODUCTS,  ESPECIALLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION, GENERIC ISRADIPINE, PHENTERMINE AND NALTREXONE, AS WELL AS MARGINS ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY\\u2019S  LICENSED MARKETING PARTNERS. LICENSE FEES EARNED ARE BASED ON IN-MARKET SALES AND ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS A NATURAL LAG BETWEEN  MANUFACTURING REVENUES EARNED BY THE COMPANY AND RELATED LICENSE FEES BEING EARNED FROM IN MARKET SALES OCCURRING SUBSEQUENT TO  THE COMPANY\\u2019S SHIPMENT OF LICENSED GENERIC PRODUCTS TO ITS MARKETING PARTNERS. IN MARKET PROFITS ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY\\u2019S  MARKETING PARTNERS ARE ALSO A FACTOR, WITH A DIRECT CORRELATION TO THE LICENSE FEE REVENUES EARNED BY THE COMPANY.  COSTS OF REVENUE CONSISTS  OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY COSTS. OUR COSTS OF REVENUE INCREASED BY $0.4 MILLION OR 25%, TO $1.8 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $1.4  MILLION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2017. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE IN LARGE PART TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS CONSISTING OF A  GREATER PROPORTION OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. COSTS OF REVENUE CONSISTS OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY  COSTS, WITH THERE BEING A STRONG CORRELATION WITH MANUFACTURING FEES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCT COMPONENTS OF  SUCH MANUFACTURING FEES.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  WAS 34% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO 44% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE  DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN IS DUE TO THE PRODUCT MIX OF GENERICS MANUFACTURED DURING THE QUARTER.  OPERATING EXPENSES.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME WAS DUE TO  DERIVATIVE INCOME RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED IN LARGE PART BY THE NUMBER OF WARRANTS  OUTSTANDING AND THE CHANGE IN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD, AS COMPARED TO  THE CLOSING PRICE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, WITH A STRONG INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES  INSTRUMENTS AND INCREASES IN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK.

MANUFACTURING FEES  INCREASED BY $0.3 MILLION, OR 7%, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN FEES EARNED FROM THE MANUFACTURE OF GENERIC NALTREXONE.  LICENSING FEES INCREASED  BY $0.1 MILLION, OR 4%. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF IN-MARKET SALES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S GENERIC PRODUCTS,  ESPECIALLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION, GENERIC ISRADIPINE AND PHENTERMINE, AS WELL AS MARGINS ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY\\u2019S LICENSED  MARKETING PARTNERS.

IN MARKET PROFITS ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY\\u2019S MARKETING PARTNERS  ARE ALSO A FACTOR, WITH A DIRECT CORRELATION TO THE LICENSE FEE REVENUES EARNED BY THE COMPANY.  OUR COSTS OF REVENUE  INCREASED BY $0.8 MILLION OR 28%, TO $3.9 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $3.0 MILLION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2017.

THE  DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN IS DUE TO THE PRODUCT MIX OF GENERICS MANUFACTURED DURING THE PERIOD, WITH THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD SPECIFICALLY  CONSISTING OF A GREATER PROPORTION OF NALTREXONE MANUFACTURING AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. .

THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO THE TIMING AND COMPOSITION OF ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF  OUR ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOID, PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT PURSUANT TO THE SUNGEN AGREEMENT AND OTHER PRODUCTS.  17  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WERE $2.2 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $0.2 MILLION OR 9% FROM $2.1 MILLION OF  SUCH COSTS FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR WITH SUCH INCREASE BEING PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  COSTS.  NON-CASH COMPENSATION  EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 WAS $0.1 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN  NON-CASH COMPENSATION EXPENSE DERIVES FROM THE TIMING IN AMORTIZATION OF THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED OVER THE COURSE  OF THE LAST THREE YEARS.

WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH RESOURCES, COMBINED WITH THE COMPANY\\u2019S ACCESS TO PART OR ALL OF THE  REMAINING $36.0 MILLION AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO THE $40 MILLION EQUITY LINE WITH LINCOLN PARK IS SUFFICIENT TO FUND OPERATIONS THROUGH  THE CURRENT OPERATING CYCLE. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS TOTALING $7.1 MILLION,  AND NET OTHER INCOME TOTALING $0.5 MILLION, RESULTING IN A NET LOSS OF $6.6 MILLION.  18  THE COMPANY DOES NOT  ANTICIPATE BEING PROFITABLE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2019, DUE IN LARGE PART TO ITS PLANS TO CONDUCT CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT  AND COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES ON A RANGE OF ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOID PRODUCTS, ON AN ACCELERATED AND SIMULTANEOUS BASIS. SUCH  ACTIVITIES REQUIRE THE INVESTMENT OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS, SAFETY AND EFFICACY STUDIES, BIOEQUIVALENCE STUDIES,  PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, REGULATORY EXPERTISE AND FILINGS, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN MANUFACTURING AND LAB EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE.  IN ORDER TO FINANCE THESE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH LINCOLN PARK CAPITAL  FUND, WITH SUCH AGREEMENT PROVIDING THE COMPANY WITH AN EQUITY LINE TOTALING $40 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THIS AMOUNT OF FINANCING,  IF RECEIVED, IS SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOID PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES  IT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR AGGREGATING ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS INTO A SINGLE REPORTING SEGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING  GUIDANCE. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE  DURGIN-PARK  PROFITABLY DUE  TO DECREASED TRAFFIC AT THE FANEUIL HALL MARKETPLACE IN BOSTON, MA, WHERE IT IS LOCATED, AND RISING LABOR COSTS. AS A RESULT, INCLUDED  IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 IS A LOSS ON CLOSURE IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,067,000 CONSISTING  OF: (I) IMPAIRMENT OF TRADEMARKS IN THE AMOUNT OF $721,000, (II) ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS IN THE AMOUNT OF $333,000,  AND (III) WRITE-OFFS OF PREPAID EXPENSES IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,000.

AT OUR PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE NORTHEAST, THE FIRST AND SECOND FISCAL QUARTERS, WHICH  INCLUDE THE WINTER MONTHS, USUALLY REFLECT LOWER CUSTOMER TRAFFIC THAN IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS. HOWEVER, SALES  IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCLEMENT WEATHER DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUTDOOR  SEATING AT THE COMPANY\\u2019S RESTAURANTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 WAS $305,000, WHICH INCLUDED A LOSS OF $1,067,000 RELATING TO THE CLOSURE OF  DURGIN-PARK  LOCATED IN BOSTON, MA.

COSTS AND EXPENSES  COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR THE  13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 AND DECEMBER 30, 2017 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  13 WEEKS  ENDED  DECEMBER 29,%  TO TOTAL  13 WEEKS  ENDED  DECEMBER 30,%  TO TOTAL  INCREASE  (DECREASE)  2018  REVENUES  2017  REVENUES  $%  FOOD AND BEVERAGE COST OF SALES  $10,476  25.8%  $10,218  26.0%  $258  2.5%  PAYROLL EXPENSES  14,105  34.8%  13,710  34.9%  395  2.9%  OCCUPANCY EXPENSES  5,005  12.3%  5,031  12.8%  (26  )  -0.5%  OTHER OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES  4,975  12.3%  5,117  13.0%  (142  )  -2.8%  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  3,409  8.4%  3,079  7.8%  330  10.7%  LOSS ON CLOSURE OF DURGIN-PARK  1,067  2.6%  -  0.0%  1,067  N/A  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  1,206  3.0%  1,303  3.3%  (97  )  -7.4%  $40,243  $38,458  $1,785  -  15  -  FOOD AND BEVERAGE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF  TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR AS EXPECTED.  PAYROLL EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES  FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF MINIMUM WAGE  INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES TO LABOR LAWS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BETTER MIX OF CATERING VERSUS A LA CARTE BUSINESS AT OUR  LARGER PROPERTIES.  OCCUPANCY EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL  REVENUES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DECREASED SLIGHTLY AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR PRIMARILY AS A  RESULT OF HIGHER SALES AT PROPERTIES WHERE RENTS ARE RELATIVELY FIXED OR WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS THE PREMISES AT WHICH THE PROPERTY  OPERATES.  OTHER OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE  OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DECREASED AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF  INCREASED SALES AS MANY OF THESE COSTS ARE FIXED.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (WHICH  RELATE SOLELY TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE IN NEW YORK CITY) AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  INCREASED AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ANNUAL WAGE INCREASES AND HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE  13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DECREASED AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ASSETS BECOMING  FULLY DEPRECIATED IN THE PRIOR PERIOD PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DEPRECIATION ON THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE AT THE  SEQUOIA  PROPERTY  WHICH WERE PLACED IN SERVICE IN THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2017.  INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY\\u2019S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  CONSISTS OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES IN AMOUNTS NECESSARY TO ALIGN THE COMPANY\\u2019S YEAR-TO-DATE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES WITH THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE FOR THE FULL YEAR. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY UPDATES ITS  ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND RECORDS CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS AS DEEMED NECESSARY.  THE INCOME TAX PROVISIONS FOR THE 13 WEEK PERIODS  ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 AND DECEMBER 30, 2017 REFLECT EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF APPROXIMATELY 287.5% AND (162.5)%, RESPECTIVELY. THE  COMPANY\\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DIFFERED THAN THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21% AS A RESULT  OF THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE GENERATION OF FICA TAX CREDITS AND OPERATING INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS  THAT IS NOT TAXABLE TO THE COMPANY. THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2017 DIFFERED FROM THE BLENDED STATUTORY  RATE OF 24% AS A RESULT OF TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE GENERATION OF FICA TAX CREDITS, OPERATING INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING  INTERESTS THAT IS NOT TAXABLE TO THE COMPANY AND THE ONE-TIME REMEASUREMENT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  FOR REDUCED FEDERAL TAX RATE ENACTED AS PART OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. THE FINAL ANNUAL TAX RATE CANNOT BE DETERMINED UNTIL  THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR; THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL TAX RATE COULD DIFFER FROM CURRENT ESTIMATES.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S OVERALL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  IN THE FUTURE WILL BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS THE UTILIZATION OF STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, THE GENERATION  OF FICA TAX CREDITS AND THE MIX OF EARNINGS BY STATE TAXING JURISDICTIONS AS NEVADA DOES NOT IMPOSE A STATE INCOME TAX, AS COMPARED  TO THE OTHER MAJOR STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CAPITAL HAS BEEN CASH  PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND, IN RECENT YEARS, BANK AND OTHER BORROWINGS TO FINANCE SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS, ACQUISITIONS AND LARGE  REMODELING PROJECTS. WE UTILIZE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS TO FUND THE COST OF DEVELOPING AND OPENING NEW RESTAURANTS AND SMALLER  REMODELING PROJECTS OF EXISTING RESTAURANTS WE OWN.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR  THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DECREASED TO $840,000 AS COMPARED TO $1,165,000 PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIOD  OF LAST YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN NET WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID,  REFUNDABLE AND ACCRUED INCOME TAXES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 AND DECEMBER 30, 2017 WERE $619,000 AND $2,516,000, RESPECTIVELY AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM PURCHASES  OF FIXED ASSETS AT EXISTING RESTAURANTS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE 13 WEEK PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 AND DECEMBER 30, 2017 OF ($2,050,000) AND $98,000, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTED PRIMARILY  FROM THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON NOTES PAYABLE AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS, OFFSET BY BORROWINGS  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  -  16  -  THE COMPANY HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIENCY  OF $4,210,000 AT DECEMBER 29, 2018 AS COMPARED WITH A DEFICIENCY OF $4,628,000 AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2018. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING  CASH BALANCES, CURRENT BANKING FACILITIES AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  SPENDING REQUIREMENTS AT LEAST THROUGH FEBRUARY 12, 2020.  ON DECEMBER 3, 2018, THE  BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.25 PER SHARE ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK TO BE PAID ON JANUARY 3,  2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON DECEMBER 18, 2018. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY SUCH QUARTERLY  CASH DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE; HOWEVER, THE PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IS BASED ON FUTURE EARNINGS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN U.S. TAXATION  AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF ITS  FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE REVOLVING FACILITY AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018.  RECENT RESTAURANT DISPOSITIONS  AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, THE COMPANY DETERMINED  THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE  DURGIN-PARK  PROFITABLY DUE TO DECREASED TRAFFIC AT THE FANEUIL HALL MARKETPLACE IN  BOSTON, MA, WHERE IT IS LOCATED, AND RISING LABOR COSTS. AS A RESULT, INCLUDED IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 13 WEEKS  ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 IS A LOSS ON CLOSURE IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,067,000 CONSISTING OF: (I) IMPAIRMENT OF TRADEMARKS IN THE AMOUNT  OF $721,000, (II) ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS IN THE AMOUNT OF $333,000, AND (III) WRITE-OFFS OF PREPAID EXPENSES  IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,000. THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED ON JANUARY 12, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES  THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS.  IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING ITS CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE APPROPRIATE CARRYING VALUE  OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. THE PRIMARY ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE COMPANY\\u2019S  CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE ALLOWANCES FOR POTENTIAL BAD DEBTS ON ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, LEASES,  THE USEFUL LIVES AND RECOVERABILITY OF ITS ASSETS, SUCH AS PROPERTY AND INTANGIBLES, FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE  REALIZABLE VALUE OF ITS TAX ASSETS AND OTHER MATTERS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH IT BELIEVES  ARE REASONABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE  THAT ANY CHANGE IN THOSE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE NEAR TERM WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  POSITION OR THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, DIFFERENCES IN ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ARE DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2018. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO  SUCH POLICIES DURING FISCAL 2019 OTHER THAN THOSE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ADOPTED AND ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE ADOPTED IN FISCAL 2019 AND THE EXPECTED DATES  OF ADOPTION AND THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"ARK RESTAURANTS CORP\", \"CIK\": 779544, \"Date\": \"2019-02-12T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"ARKR\", \"Name\": \"Ark Restaurants Corp\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 5812.0, \"Business\": \"NY\", \"Incorporated\": \"NY\", \"IRS\": 133156768.0, \"key\": \"20190212ARKR\", \"labelr1\": 9.97289972899729, \"labelr2\": -2.661409561360272, \"labelr3\": -1.2658227848101269, \"labelr4\": 0.0, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.59379154, \"prof1\": 0.40620850000000003, \"return1&2\": 0.9242309012543058, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9359300265866388, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.9359300265866388, \"return2\": 1.0266140956136027, \"return1\": 0.9002710027100271, \"return3\": 1.0126582278481011, \"return4\": 1.0, \"1_day_return\": 9.972899728997287, \"cumulative_return1\": 1.7194136339510144, \"cumulative_return1&2\": 1.6698207747642697, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": 0.7470959937451928, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.564991817044712, \"indexx\": 135, \"returnpred\": -9.97289972899729, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9842219394851218, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.0067811569537253, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9541500265528086, \"cumreturndow\": 1.017180670268484, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0191262766492386}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 146, \"level_0\": 149, \"index\": 24947, \"text\": \"ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  ESPEY MFG. & ELECTRONICS CORP. (\\u201cESPEY\\u201d)  IS A POWER ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (OEM) COMPANY WITH A LONG HISTORY OF DEVELOPING AND DELIVERING  HIGHLY RELIABLE PRODUCTS FOR USE IN MILITARY AND SEVERE ENVIRONMENT APPLICATIONS. DESIGN, MANUFACTURING, AND TESTING IS PERFORMED  IN OUR 150,000+ SQUARE FOOT FACILITY LOCATED AT 233 BALLSTON AVE, SARATOGA SPRINGS, NEW YORK. ESPEY IS CLASSIFIED AS A \\u201cSMALLER  REPORTING COMPANY\\u201d FOR PURPOSES OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. ESPEY\\u2019S  COMMON STOCK IS PUBLICLY-TRADED ON THE NYSE AMERICAN UNDER THE SYMBOL \\u201cESP.\\u201d  ESPEY BEGAN OPERATIONS AFTER INCORPORATION  IN NEW YORK IN 1928. WE STRIVE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AS A LEADER IN HIGH POWER ENERGY CONVERSION AND TRANSFORMER SOLUTIONS THROUGH  THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS BY USING ADVANCED AND \\u201cCUTTING EDGE\\u201d ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES.  ESPEY IS ISO 9001:2015 AND AS9100:2016 CERTIFIED.  OUR PRIMARY PRODUCTS ARE POWER SUPPLIES, POWER CONVERTERS, FILTERS, POWER TRANSFORMERS, MAGNETIC COMPONENTS, POWER DISTRIBUTION  EQUIPMENT, UPS SYSTEMS, ANTENNAS AND HIGH POWER RADAR SYSTEMS. THE APPLICATIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE AC AND DC LOCOMOTIVES,  SHIPBOARD POWER, SHIPBOARD RADAR, AIRBORNE POWER, GROUND-BASED RADAR, AND GROUND MOBILE POWER.  ESPEY SERVICES INCLUDE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT  TO SPECIFICATION, BUILD TO PRINT, DESIGN SERVICES, DESIGN STUDIES, ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING SERVICES, METAL FABRICATION, PAINTING  SERVICES, AND DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATIC TESTING EQUIPMENT. ESPEY IS VERTICALLY INTEGRATED, MEANING THAT THE COMPANY PRODUCES INDIVIDUAL  COMPONENTS (INCLUDING INDUCTORS), POPULATES PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS, FABRICATES METALWORK, PAINTS, WIRES, QUALIFIES, AND FULLY TESTS  ITEMS, MECHANICALLY, ELECTRICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY, IN HOUSE. PORTIONS OF THE MANUFACTURING AND TESTING PROCESS ARE SUBCONTRACTED  TO VENDORS FROM TIME TO TIME.  THE COMPANY MARKETS ITS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY  THROUGH ITS OWN DIRECT SALES ORGANIZATION AND THROUGH OUTSIDE SALES REPRESENTATIVES. BUSINESS IS SOLICITED FROM LARGE INDUSTRIAL  MANUFACTURERS AND DEFENSE COMPANIES, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND MAJOR FOREIGN ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT  COMPANIES. ESPEY IS ALSO ON THE ELIGIBLE LIST OF CONTRACTORS WITH THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. WE PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES  FOR PRIME CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND ARE GENERALLY AUTOMATICALLY SOLICITED BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE  PROCUREMENT AGENCIES FOR THEIR NEEDS FALLING WITHIN THE MAJOR CLASSES OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY. ESPEY CONTRACTS WITH  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER CAGE CODE 20950 AS ESPEY MFG. & ELECTRONICS CORP.  THERE IS COMPETITION IN ALL CLASSES OF PRODUCTS  MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, RANGING FROM DIVISIONS OF THE LARGEST ELECTRONIC COMPANIES, TO MANY SMALL COMPANIES. THE COMPANY'S  SALES DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE INDUSTRY'S MARKET FOR ANY CLASS OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION  FOR ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS OF BOTH A MILITARY AND INDUSTRIAL NATURE INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, PRICE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, THE  EXPERIENCE OF THE PARTICULAR COMPANY AND HISTORY OF ITS DEALINGS IN SUCH PRODUCTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS NOT SEASONAL. HOWEVER, THE  CONCENTRATION OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE RAIL INDUSTRY, AND IN EQUIPMENT FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, AND  OUR CUSTOMER CONCENTRATIONS EXPOSE US TO ON-GOING ASSOCIATED RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REQUIREMENTS FOR POWER  SUPPLIES IN THE RAIL INDUSTRY, DEPENDENCE ON APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENTS OF FOREIGN NATIONS,  PROGRAM ALLOCATIONS, THE POTENTIAL OF GOVERNMENTAL TERMINATION OF ORDERS FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THE GENERAL STRENGTH OF THE INDUSTRY  SECTORS IN WHICH OUR CUSTOMERS TRANSACT BUSINESS.  IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR NEW BUSINESS,  IN SOME CASES WE HAVE INVESTED IN UPFRONT DESIGN COSTS, THEREBY REDUCING INITIAL PROFITABILITY AS A MEANS OF PROCURING NEW LONG-TERM  PROGRAMS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY, WE ADJUST OUR PRICING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A BALANCE WHICH ENABLES US BOTH TO RETAIN REPEAT PROGRAMS  WHILE BEING MORE COMPETITIVE IN BIDDING ON NEW PROGRAMS.  IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED BUSINESS, WE  ARE CONTINUING TO PLACE AN EMPHASIS ON SECURING \\u201cBUILD TO PRINT\\u201d OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH WILL ALLOW PRODUCTION WORK TO  GO DIRECTLY TO THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR, LIMITING THE IMPACT ON OUR ENGINEERING STAFF. THIS EFFORT WILL KEEP OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM  BUSY WHILE THE PRODUCTS BEING DEVELOPED TRANSITION TO PRODUCTION.  9  INDEX  THE TOTAL BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS  APPROXIMATELY $45.8 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $24.0 MILLION FROM THREE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, COMPARED TO $38.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER  31, 2017, WHICH INCLUDED $19.0 MILLION FROM THREE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY\\u2019S TOTAL BACKLOG REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED  REMAINING SALES VALUE OF WORK TO BE PERFORMED UNDER FIRM CONTRACTS. THE FUNDED PORTION OF THIS BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 IS  APPROXIMATELY $42.9 MILLION. THIS INCLUDES ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED AND APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS AND/OR FUNDED BY THE CUSTOMER.  THE UNFUNDED BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 IS APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION AND REPRESENTS A FIRM MULTI-YEAR ORDER FOR WHICH FUNDING  HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS OR FUNDED BY OUR CUSTOMER. WHILE THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT FUTURE BUDGETS AND APPROPRIATIONS  WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS, MANAGEMENT HAS INCLUDED IN UNFUNDED BACKLOG ONLY THOSE PROGRAMS THAT IT BELIEVES  ARE LIKELY TO RECEIVE FUNDING BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH CUSTOMERS AND PROGRAM STATUS. THE UNFUNDED BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2017  WAS $5.0 MILLION. FOR BOTH FISCAL PERIODS ENDED 2018 AND 2017, THE UNFUNDED BACKLOG IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF THE SAME MULTI-YEAR  ORDER FROM A SINGLE CUSTOMER.  SUCCESSFUL CONVERSION OF ENGINEERING PROGRAM  BACKLOG INTO SALES IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE EXECUTION AND COMPLETION OF OUR ENGINEERING DESIGN EFFORTS.   IT IS NOT  UNCOMMON TO EXPERIENCE TECHNICAL OR SCHEDULING DELAYS WHICH ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF, AMONG OTHER REASONS, DESIGN  COMPLEXITY, THE AVAILABILITY OF PERSONNEL WITH THE REQUISITE EXPERTISE, AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN CUSTOMER APPROVAL AT VARIOUS  MILESTONES.  COST OVERRUNS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE DELAYS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TIMING OF THE CONVERSION  OF BACKLOG INTO SALES, OR THE PROFITABILITY OF SUCH SALES.  WHILE RECENTLY, WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE  DELAYS WITH OUR MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, THESE DELAYS ARE BEING RESOLVED AS THEY ARISE AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT ANY NEGATIVE  IMPACT ON OUR CUSTOMER ORDER FULFILLMENT PROJECTIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. ENGINEERING PROGRAMS IN BOTH THE FUNDED AND UNFUNDED  PORTIONS OF THE CURRENT BACKLOG AGGREGATE $6.7 MILLION.  MANAGEMENT EXPECTS REVENUES  IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 TO BE HIGHER THAN REVENUES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018 BUT EXPECTS THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN TO BE LOWER IN FISCAL  YEAR 2019 THAN THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018. THIS EXPECTATION IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER PROFIT MARGIN ORDERS  ALREADY IN OUR BACKLOG THAT WILL BE SHIPPED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. AS MARKET FACTORS INCLUDING COMPETITION AND PRODUCT COSTS  IMPACT GROSS PROFIT MARGINS, MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR SALES STRATEGY, EMPLOYMENT LEVELS, AND FACILITY COSTS.  NEW ORDERS RECEIVED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE APPROXIMATELY $13.4 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $14.3 MILLION OF NEW ORDERS RECEIVED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2018. IT IS PRESENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT A MINIMUM OF $24.4 MILLION OF ORDERS COMPRISING THE DECEMBER 31, 2018 BACKLOG  WILL BE FILLED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2019. THE MINIMUM OF $24.4 MILLION DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY SHIPMENTS, WHICH  MAY BE MADE AGAINST ORDERS SUBSEQUENTLY RECEIVED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2019. THE ESTIMATE OF THE DECEMBER 31,  2018 BACKLOG TO BE SHIPPED IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 IS SUBJECT TO FUTURE EVENTS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THE BACKLOG ACTUALLY  SHIPPED TO DIFFER FROM SUCH ESTIMATE.  IN ADDITION TO THE BACKLOG, THE COMPANY  CURRENTLY HAS OUTSTANDING OPPORTUNITIES REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY $60.0 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 FOR  BOTH REPEAT AND NEW PROGRAMS.  THE OUTSTANDING QUOTATIONS ENCOMPASS VARIOUS NEW AND PREVIOUSLY MANUFACTURED POWER  SUPPLIES, TRANSFORMERS, AND SUBASSEMBLIES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL ACQUIRE ANY OF THE  ANTICIPATED ORDERS DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES DEFENSE SPENDING AND  FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  BUSINESS IS THE PRODUCTION OF MILITARY AND INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT FOR USE BY THE U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND CERTAIN  INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS. NET SALES TO TWO SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 49.4% OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S TOTAL SALES FOR THE THREE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND NET SALES TO THREE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 63.2% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL SALES FOR  THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. NET SALES TO TWO SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 54.4% AND 61.0% OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  TOTAL SALES FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THIS HIGH CONCENTRATION LEVEL WITH THESE CUSTOMERS  PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT RISK. A LOSS OF ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS OR PROGRAMS RELATED TO THESE CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE  COMPANY. HISTORICALLY, A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S TOTAL SALES IN  ANY GIVEN FISCAL YEAR.  10  INDEX  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING  POLICIES INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION AND COST ESTIMATION ON OUR CONTRACTS.  REVENUE  THE MAJORITY OF OUR NET SALES IS GENERATED  FROM CONTRACTS WITH INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURERS AND DEFENSE COMPANIES, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, OTHER AGENCIES OF THE GOVERNMENT  OF THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS. CONTRACTS MAY BE LONG-TERM  IN NATURE. WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS. UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS  WE AGREE TO PERFORM THE SPECIFIED WORK FOR A PRE-DETERMINED PRICE. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL COSTS VARY FROM THE ESTIMATES UPON  WHICH THE PRICE WAS NEGOTIATED, WE WILL GENERATE MORE OR LESS PROFIT OR COULD INCUR A LOSS.  WE ACCOUNT FOR A CONTRACT AFTER IT HAS BEEN  APPROVED BY ALL PARTIES TO THE ARRANGEMENT, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES ARE IDENTIFIED, PAYMENT TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE CONTRACT  HAS COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE, AND COLLECTABILITY OF CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLE. WE ASSESS EACH CONTRACT AT ITS INCEPTION TO DETERMINE  WHETHER IT SHOULD BE COMBINED WITH OTHER CONTRACTS. WHEN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS WHETHER TWO OR  MORE CONTRACTS WERE NEGOTIATED AND EXECUTED AT OR NEAR THE SAME TIME, OR WERE NEGOTIATED WITH AN OVERALL PROFIT OBJECTIVE.  WE EVALUATE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROMISED  IN EACH CONTRACT AT INCEPTION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONTRACT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HAVING ONE OR MORE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR EACH CONTRACT BASED  ON THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE FOR THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE TRANSACTION PRICE  FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE UNDERLYING EACH PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION. TRANSACTION PRICES ON OUR CONTRACTS SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON ESTIMATED  COSTS PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT MARGIN.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE USING THE OUTPUT METHOD  BASED ON THE APPRAISAL OF RESULTS ACHIEVED AND MILESTONES REACHED OR UNITS DELIVERED BASED ON CONTRACTUAL SHIPMENT TERMS, TYPICALLY  SHIPPING POINT.  INVENTORY  INVENTORIED WORK RELATING TO CONTRACTS  IN PROCESS AND WORK IN PROCESS IS VALUED AT ACTUAL PRODUCTION COST, INCLUDING FACTORY OVERHEAD INCURRED TO DATE. CONTRACT COSTS  INCLUDE MATERIAL, SUBCONTRACT COSTS, LABOR, AND AN ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD COSTS. WORK IN PROCESS REPRESENTS SPARE UNITS AND PARTS  AND OTHER INVENTORY ITEMS ACQUIRED OR PRODUCED TO SERVICE UNITS PREVIOUSLY SOLD OR TO MEET ANTICIPATED FUTURE ORDERS. PROVISION  FOR LOSSES ON CONTRACTS IS MADE WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH LOSSES BECOMES PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE.  THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES  ON CONTRACTS IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S BALANCE SHEET.  THE COSTS ATTRIBUTED TO UNITS DELIVERED  UNDER CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE COST OF ALL UNITS EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED.  CERTAIN CONTRACTS ARE EXPECTED  TO EXTEND BEYOND TWELVE MONTHS.  THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION  OF A CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS VARIABLES INVOLVING CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE THE  CONTRACT.  GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESSES AND JUDGMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MATERIALLY  DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED SALES AND CONTRACT COSTS COULD BE RECORDED IF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED, BASED ON CHANGES IN  CIRCUMSTANCES, IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS.  WHEN A CHANGE IN EXPECTED SALES VALUE OR ESTIMATED COST IS DETERMINED, CHANGES  ARE REFLECTED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.  CONTRACT LIABILITIES  CONTRACT LIABILITIES INCLUDE ADVANCE PAYMENTS  AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.  11  INDEX  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET SALES DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $7,303,109 AS COMPARED TO $11,531,105 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. NET SALES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018 DECREASED TO $15,640,508 AS COMPARED TO $19,027,528 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018, THE DECLINE IN NET SALES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN POWER SUPPLY SHIPMENTS ON A SPECIFIC MILITARY CONTRACT AND A DECREASE  IN SHIPMENTS SUPPORTING THE RAIL INDUSTRY. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE DECREASE IN NET SALES IS PRIMARILY DUE  TO THE TIMING OF POWER SUPPLY SHIPMENTS RELATED TO A SPECIFIC MILITARY CONTRACT WHICH HAD SIGNIFICANT SHIPMENTS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL  YEAR, OFFSET IN PART BY AN INCREASE IN BUILD TO PRINT SALES. THIS DECLINE IN BOTH PERIODS IS LARGELY DUE TO TIMING OF SHIPMENTS  BASED ON CUSTOMER CONTRACTUAL DELIVERY DATES AND SHIPMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN MADE DUE TO ENGINEERING DESIGN CHANGES REQUIRED TO  MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN SUPPLIER PRODUCT NON-CONFORMANCES AND AN INCREASE IN LEAD TIMES FOR CERTAIN ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS  DUE TO INDUSTRY SHORTAGES AND VOLATILITY WITHIN THE POWER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS  AND SUPPLIERS TO EXECUTE ON OUR CURRENT PAST DUE DELIVERIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS SITUATION TO IMPACT FUTURE BUSINESS.  GROSS PROFITS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018 AND 2017 WERE $1,516,235 AND $3,075,598, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS 20.8% AND 26.7%, FOR  THE SAME PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, GROSS PROFITS WERE $2,509,169 AND $4,536,752,  RESPECTIVELY. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS 16.0% AND 23.8%, FOR THE SAME PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS  IN DETERMINING THE CHANGE IN GROSS PROFIT AND NET INCOME ARE OVERALL SALES LEVELS AND PRODUCT MIX. THE GROSS PROFITS ON MATURE  PRODUCTS AND BUILD TO PRINT CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY HIGHER AS COMPARED TO PRODUCTS WHICH ARE STILL IN THE ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT  STAGE OR IN EARLY STAGES OF PRODUCTION. IN THE CASE OF THE LATTER, THE COMPANY CAN INCUR WHAT IT REFERS TO AS \\u201cLOSS CONTRACTS,\\u201d  MEANING ENGINEERING DESIGN CONTRACTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY INVESTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING FUTURE PRODUCT SALES. IN ANY  GIVEN ACCOUNTING PERIOD THE MIX OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS BETWEEN HIGHER MARGIN PROGRAMS AND LESS MATURE PROGRAMS, AND EXPENDITURES  ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS CONTRACTS, HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GROSS PROFIT AND NET INCOME. THE GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE DECREASED  IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INCURRED  SPENDING RELATED TO A SPECIFIC ENGINEERING DESIGN CONTRACT. THIS INCREASE IN SPENDING REDUCED THE GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE BY 7.2%  AND 8.0% FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  WERE $1,295,687 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018; AN INCREASE OF $313,317, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2017. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $2,305,231 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018; AN INCREASE  OF $444,041 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED  TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017 RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDED PROGRAM MANAGEMENT  PERSONNEL SUPPORTING THE COMPANY\\u2019S SALES BACKLOG, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. THE INCREASE FOR  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017 RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASES DESCRIBED FOR  THE THREE MONTH PERIOD, HOWEVER, FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE INCREASES WERE OFFSET, IN PART, BY A REDUCTION  IN TRAVEL, AND INCURRED MARKETING COSTS.  OTHER INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 WAS $53,361 AND $43,289, RESPECTIVELY. OTHER INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017  WAS $129,432 AND $84,685, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS IS PRIMARILY DUE AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME  RESULTING FROM THE GRADUAL INCREASE IN CURRENT YIELD PERCENTAGES EARNED ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES. INTEREST INCOME IS A FUNCTION  OF THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES WHICH GENERALLY TEND TO BE CONSERVATIVE.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR  THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WERE 20.5% AND 16.2%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 24.4% AND 25.5% FOR THE THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE STATUTORY TAX RATE WAS REDUCED FROM 34% TO 21% UNDER THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE  \\u201cTAX ACT\\u2019) EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2019 IS LESS THAN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE  MAINLY DUE TO THE BENEFIT DERIVED FROM THE ESOP DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALLOCATED SHARES AND FOR THE TAX BENEFIT RECEIVED IN THE FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 IS LESS THAN THE STATUTORY TAX  RATE MAINLY DUE TO THE BENEFIT THE COMPANY RECEIVED ON ITS \\u201cQUALIFIED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES\\u201d UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS  CREATION ACT OF 2004 WHICH EXPIRED AFTER THE END OF FISCAL 2018 AND THE BENEFIT DERIVED FROM THE ESOP DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALLOCATED  SHARES.  NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018, WAS $217,758 OR $0.09 PER SHARE BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED, RESPECTIVELY COMPARED TO $1,614,871 OR $0.69 PER SHARE  BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. NET INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WAS  $279,430 OR $0.12 PER SHARE BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED COMPARED TO $2,057,635 OR $0.88 PER SHARE BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME PER SHARE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS DUE  TO LOWER SALES, LOWER GROSS PROFIT AND AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS  IN 2017 AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THESE DECREASES WERE MITIGATED, IN PART, BY AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME AND A REDUCTION IN INCOME  TAXES RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE DECREASE IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTING FROM THE DECREASE IN THE STATUTORY  TAX RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  12  INDEX  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY'S WORKING CAPITAL IS AN APPROPRIATE  INDICATOR OF THE LIQUIDITY OF ITS BUSINESS, AND DURING THE PAST TWO FISCAL YEARS, THE COMPANY, WHEN POSSIBLE, HAS FUNDED ALL OF  ITS OPERATIONS WITH CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND WHEN NECESSARY FROM ITS EXISTING CASH AND INVESTMENTS. THE  COMPANY DID NOT BORROW ANY FUNDS DURING THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. MANAGEMENT HAS AVAILABLE A $3,000,000 LINE OF CREDIT TO HELP  FUND FURTHER GROWTH OR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, IF NECESSARY, BUT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR ANY BORROWED FUNDS IN THE FORESEEABLE  FUTURE. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AGGREGATED TO ZERO AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND  2017. THE LINE OF CREDIT IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY IN NOVEMBER FOR RENEWAL BY DECEMBER 1  ST.  THE COMPANY'S WORKING CAPITAL AS OF DECEMBER  31, 2018 AND 2017 WAS APPROXIMATELY $26.7 MILLION AND $30.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE THREE AND SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FROM THE COMPANY\\u2019S EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN  AND TRUST (\\u201cESOP\\u201d). DURING THE THREE AND SIX-MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 4,798 SHARES OF  ITS COMMON STOCK FROM THE ESOP FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $109,694. UNDER EXISTING AUTHORIZATIONS FROM THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS,  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, MANAGEMENT IS AUTHORIZED TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL $876,297 OF COMPANY STOCK.  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE SUMMARY  OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE FISCAL YEARS INDICATED.  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  2017  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(3,015,611  )  $596,844  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  5,379,283  (2,180,684  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (3,350,612  )  (1,272,076  )  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FLUCTUATES BETWEEN PERIODS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DIFFERENCES IN SALES AND NET INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, THE TIMING  OF THE COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PURCHASE OF INVENTORY, AND PAYMENT OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN  OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY RELATES TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME AND INCOME TAX PAYABLE AND THE INCREASE  IN INVENTORIES ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALES VOLUME AND BACKLOG INCREASES OFFSET, IN PART, BY A DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER  CURRENT ASSETS, THE COLLECTION OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AND THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATURING  INVESTMENTS OFFSET, IN PART, BY AN INCREASE IN SPENDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. THE INCREASE IN CASH  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CASH EXPENDED FOR THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND TOTALING  $1.00 PER SHARE DECLARED AND PAID IN FISCAL 2019 OFFSET, IN PART, BY PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS DURING  THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT  THE CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND WHEN NECESSARY, FROM CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS LONG-TERM  FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018 AND 2017, THE COMPANY EXPENDED $354,933 AND $185,190, RESPECTIVELY, FOR PLANT IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY  HAS BUDGETED APPROXIMATELY $750,000 FOR NEW EQUIPMENT AND PLANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019. MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT THE  FUNDS REQUIRED WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM CURRENT OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANY'S  RESERVE FOR BAD DEBTS OF $3,000 IS ADEQUATE GIVEN THE CUSTOMERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY DOES BUSINESS. HISTORICALLY, BAD DEBT EXPENSE  HAS BEEN MINIMAL.  13  INDEX  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE \\\"SAFE  HARBOR\\\" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE  SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995  THIS REPORT CONTAINS \\\"FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS\\\" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

WE REVIEW THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN REPORTING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE EVALUATE OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND MAY EMPLOY OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES WE USE ARE REASONABLE; HOWEVER, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IDENTIFY OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE THE POLICIES THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE REPRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS AND REQUIRE OUR MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.  GOING CONCERN  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS. THE GOING CONCERN BASIS ASSUMES THAT WE WILL CONTINUE IN OPERATION FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND WILL BE ABLE TO REALIZE ITS ASSETS AND DISCHARGE ITS LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  PREDICTIVE BIOTECH, INC., A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, BEGAN OPERATIONS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017. SINCE INCEPTION OF OPERATIONS, REVENUES HAVE EXCEEDED CASH EXPENSES AND SUCH EXCESS CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS OF PTG.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RAISED SUFFICIENT CAPITAL THROUGH STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR LICENSES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS PRODUCTS UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE INITIAL SALE OF SUCH PRODUCTS WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE FIRST HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2019 AND ACCELERATING THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF CALENDAR 2019.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT.  AT THE PRESENT TIME MOST SALES ARE THROUGH CREDIT CARDS, HOWEVER FROM TIME TO TIME, CREDIT IS GRANTED TO CUSTOMERS ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS WITHOUT REQUIRING COLLATERAL, AND AS SUCH, THESE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, DO NOT BEAR INTEREST, ALTHOUGH A FINANCE CHARGE MAY BE APPLIED TO SUCH RECEIVABLES THAT ARE PAST DUE.  THE COMPANY HAS IN PLACE CREDIT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SALES RETURNS AND CREDIT MEMOS.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF HCT/PS WE PRODUCE. WE VALUE INVENTORY AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. WE DETERMINE THE COST OF INVENTORY USING THE STANDARD-COST METHOD, WHICH APPROXIMATES ACTUAL COST BASED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD. ALL OTHER COSTS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  WE ANALYZE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ANNUALLY AND WRITE DOWN INVENTORY THAT HAS A COST BASIS IN EXCESS OF ITS EXPECTED NET REALIZABLE VALUE, OR THAT IS CONSIDERED IN EXCESS OF NORMAL OPERATING LEVELS, AS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT.  THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS RECEIVABLE  STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE RECORDED AS CONTRA-EQUITY ON THE DAY THE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT IS SIGNED AND ACCEPTED. ALL STOCK SUBSCRIBED AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAS BEEN COLLECTED. THE STOCK IS NOT ISSUED UNTIL SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE COLLECTED.  PREPAID EXPENSES  AMOUNTS PAID IN ADVANCE FOR EXPENSES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS PREPAID EXPENSES AND CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS IF SUCH AMOUNTS ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE WITH THE CURRENT PERIOD.  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  LAB EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE LESSER OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR LEASE TERMS. LAB EQUIPMENT ITEMS HAVE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF FIVE YEARS, FURNITURE ITEMS HAVE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF 5 TO 7 YEARS, AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT ITEMS HAVE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF 3 YEARS. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS  INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE COMPRISED OF ACQUIRED PATENTS, LICENSES, TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND AMORTIZED OVER THE SHORTER OF THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OR THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  25  LONG-LIVED ASSETS, SUCH AS PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AS WELL AS ACQUISITION COSTS OF SUBSIDIARIES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, TYPICALLY AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, OR WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  SUCH EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY INCLUDE SWEEPING REGULATORY CHANGES, SHIFTS IN MARKET DEMAND THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE, RESTRICTIONS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, OVERALL INDUSTRY DETERIORATION, DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, RAPIDLY INCREASING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCTION INPUTS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMPANY MANAGEMENT OR COMPANY STRATEGY, AND/OR SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION.  THE COMPANY FIRST WILL ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS ABOVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST TO IDENTIFY ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS.  RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP TO ESTIMATED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS, OR FAIR VALUE, OF THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING LIVES.  THE COMPANY USED A QUALIFIED, INDEPENDENT, AND CERTIFIED THIRD-PARTY VALUATION EXPERT TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT DETERMINE FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY THEN COMPARED FAIR VALUE TO CARRYING VALUE.  OTHER THAN WHAT IS RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEEN ABOVE, THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL ASSET GROUPS IN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN OR CLOSE TO CARRYING VALUE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED THE CONVERGED STANDARD ON REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING A SINGLE, COMPREHENSIVE MODEL FOR ALL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF COMPANIES REPORTING USING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS AND U.S. GAAP. THE STANDARD CONTAINS PRINCIPLES THAT AN ENTITY MUST APPLY TO DETERMINE THE MEASUREMENT OF REVENUE AND TIMING OF WHEN IT IS RECOGNIZED. THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE IS THAT AN ENTITY MUST RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AT AN AMOUNT THAT THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. AN ENTITY CAN APPLY THE REVENUE STANDARD RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PRIOR REPORTING PERIOD PRESENTED (FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD) OR RETROSPECTIVELY WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING THE STANDARD RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION IN RETAINED EARNINGS (MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD).  THE STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JULY 1, 2018. THE COMPANY ELECTED TO ADOPT THE STANDARD USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THIS APPROACH WAS ADOPTED BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE NEW STANDARD HAS VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR THE CURRENT PRODUCTS SOLD.  THE COMPANY GENERATES REVENUE BY SELLING HUMAN CELL AND TISSUE PRODUCTS (HC/TP\\u2019S) TO CLINICS AND DOCTORS. REVENUE FROM THESE SALES ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT NET OF ANY DISCOUNTS OR CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCES. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT INDICATES TRANSFER OF CONTROL FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES.  WE HAVE EVALUATED EACH OF THE FIVE STEPS IN TOPIC 606, WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS.  1) IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER;  2) IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT;  3) DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE;  4) ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS; AND  5) RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN (OR AS) PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED.  OUR CONCLUSION IS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SIMILAR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER ASC TOPIC 606 AS COMPARED WITH DELIVERABLES AND SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNT PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED UNDER THE OLD STANDARD. AS A RESULT, THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUE APPEARS TO REMAIN THE SAME IN COMPARISON TO THE PRIOR REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE.  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH A DIRECT SALES FORCE AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTION IN THE U.S.  REVENUES FROM THESE CUSTOMERS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN ALL THE FIVE STEPS IDENTIFIED ABOVE HAVE OCCURRED.  THESE CRITERIA ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT WHEN RISK OF LOSS AND TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER.  WE RESERVE FOR SALES RETURNS, INCLUDING RETURNS RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, AS A REDUCTION IN NET SALES, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.  THESE RESERVES ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN NET SALES AND ARE NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR 6 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE WITH HISTORICAL DISCOUNT PATTERNS AND USES THIS EXPERIENCE TO FINALIZE TRANSACTION PRICES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASU 2016-12, THE COMPANY WOULD ELECT TO EXCLUDE FROM THE MEASUREMENT OF TRANSACTION PRICE, ALL TAXES ASSESSED BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY THAT ARE BOTH IMPOSED ON AND CONCURRENT WITH A SPECIFIC REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTION AND COLLECTED BY THE COMPANY FROM A CUSTOMER FOR E.G. SALES TAX, VALUE ADDED TAX ETC.  HOWEVER, AS OUR BUSINESS IS THUS FAR NOT WITH THE END CONSUMER, THE COLLECTION OF TAXES IS UNNECESSARY.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ELECTED TO APPLY THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT FOR NOT ADJUSTING REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. THIS PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT HAS BEEN ELECTED BECAUSE THE COMPANY COLLECTS CASH DIRECTLY FROM CUSTOMERS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO SHIPMENT.  THERE ARE ALSO CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING TOPIC 606. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING OUR CONTROL FRAMEWORK FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION AND IDENTIFYING ANY CHANGES THAT MAY NEED TO BE MADE IN RESPONSE TO THE NEW GUIDANCE. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE IN TOPIC 606 HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED IN COMPARISON TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CURRENT GUIDANCE.  SHIPPING AND HANDLING  WE BILL OUR CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING CHARGES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES FOR THE APPLICABLE PERIOD, AND THE CORRESPONDING SHIPPING AND HANDLING EXPENSE IS REPORTED IN COST OF SALES.  26  RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS  WE EXPENSE RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS INCURRED.  PRODUCT LIABILITY AND WARRANTY COSTS  WE MAINTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE AND HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY RELATED CLAIMS FROM ITS PRODUCTS OFFERINGS. WE ALSO OFFER A WARRANTY TO CUSTOMERS PROVIDING THAT ITS PRODUCTS WILL BE DELIVERED FREE OF ANY MATERIALS DEFECTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL COSTS INCURRED SINCE INCEPTION BASED ON ESTIMATED RETURN RATES.  WE REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED ACCRUAL ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  INCOME TAXES  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED TO REFLECT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING ENACTED STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS TO FUTURE YEARS IN WHICH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. THE IMPACT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A CHANGE IN TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT THE RATE CHANGE IS ENACTED.  MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE  THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE RECEIVED UPON THE SALE OF AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS. A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS USED TO PRIORITIZE THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE INFORMATION USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES.  CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS DEFINED IN THE FOLLOWING THREE CATEGORIES.  LEVEL 1: QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL 2: OBSERVABLE MARKET-BASED INPUTS OR INPUTS THAT ARE CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.  LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF SALES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS.  KEY ESTIMATES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURNS, PROVISIONS FOR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  (\\u201cASU 2016-02\\u201d), WHICH MODIFIED LEASE ACCOUNTING FOR BOTH LESSEES AND LESSORS TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES BY LESSEES FOR THOSE LEASES CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND DISCLOSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. ASU 2016-02 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JULY 1, 2019 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE TIMING OF ITS ADOPTION AND THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE NEW LEASE STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2017-01,  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (TOPIC 805): CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS  , WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO ENTITIES TO ASSIST WITH EVALUATING WHEN A SET OF TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES IS A BUSINESS AND PROVIDES A SCREEN TO DETERMINE WHEN A SET IS NOT A BUSINESS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WHEN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FAIR VALUE OF GROSS ASSETS ACQUIRED (OR DISPOSED OF) IS CONCENTRATED IN A SINGLE IDENTIFIABLE ASSET, OR GROUP OF SIMILAR ASSETS, THE ASSETS ACQUIRED WOULD NOT REPRESENT A BUSINESS. ALSO, TO BE CONSIDERED A BUSINESS, AN ACQUISITION WOULD HAVE TO INCLUDE AN INPUT AND A SUBSTANTIVE PROCESS THAT TOGETHER SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE OUTPUTS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, AND SHOULD BE APPLIED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS TO ANY TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING WITHIN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIODS IN WHICH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-01 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-16,  INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740): INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS OTHER THAN INVENTORY  , WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET, OTHER THAN INVENTORY, WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS. ASU 2016-16 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASU 2016-16 ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-15,  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (TOPIC 230): CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS  , WHICH ADDRESSES EIGHT SPECIFIC CASH FLOW ISSUES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING THE EXISTING DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE IN HOW CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS ARE PRESENTED AND CLASSIFIED IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. ASU 2016-15 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018 WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JANUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-01,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - OVERALL: RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES,  WHICH AMENDS THE GUIDANCE REGARDING THE CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL  27  INSTRUMENTS. CHANGES TO THE CURRENT GUIDANCE PRIMARILY AFFECT THE ACCOUNTING FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS, FINANCIAL LIABILITIES UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, AND THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. IN ADDITION, ASU 2016-01 CLARIFIES GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ASSESSMENT WHEN RECOGNIZING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESULTING FROM UNREALIZED LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES. ASU 2016-01 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED EXCEPT FOR THE PROVISION TO RECORD FAIR VALUE CHANGES FOR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION RESULTING FROM INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01, AN ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE AMENDMENTS BY MEANS OF A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2015-17,  INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740): BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES  , WHICH WILL REQUIRE ALL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES TO BE PRESENTED AS NONCURRENT WITHIN A CLASSIFIED BALANCE SHEET. ASU 2015-17 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US AS OF JULY 1, 2017. ASU 2015-17 MAY BE APPLIED EITHER PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. WE HAVE ELECTED NOT TO EARLY ADOPT ASU 2015-17. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2015-17 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  , TO UPDATE THE FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. TOPIC 606 OUTLINES A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE MODEL FOR ENTITIES TO USE IN ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPERSEDES MOST CURRENT REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE. THE GUIDANCE IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. THE GUIDANCE ALSO  REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS AND ASSETS RECOGNIZED FROM COSTS INCURRED TO FULFILL A CONTRACT. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018, AND ENTITIES HAVE THE OPTION OF USING EITHER A FULL RETROSPECTIVE OR A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD. WE HAVE EVALUATED THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS AND BELIEVE IT WILL HAVE NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THIS STANDARD ON A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE BASIS.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  PREDICTIVE THERAPEUTICS, LLC  ON APRIL 15, 2015, GLOBAL ENTERPRISES GROUP, INC. (\\u201cGLHO\\u201d) ACQUIRED 100% OF PREDICTIVE THERAPEUTICS, LLC.  AFTER THE ACQUISITION, GLHO CHANGED ITS NAME TO PREDICTIVE TECHNOLOGY GROUP, INC.   ON OCTOBER 31, 2015, THE INITIAL AGREEMENT WAS MODIFIED TO MAKE CERTAIN TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHICH WERE NOT MET AT THAT DATE.  THE COMPANY ISSUED A TOTAL OF 131,058,458 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN THIS TRANSACTION.  UNDER THIS MERGER AGREEMENT, THERE WAS A CHANGE IN CONTROL WHICH HAS BEEN TREATED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AS A REVERSE RECAPITALIZATION.  LIFECODE GENETICS, INC.,  ON NOVEMBER 6, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE ACQUISITION OF LIFECODE GENETICS, INC. (\\u201cLIFECODE\\u201d) AS ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY. LIFECODE HOLDS A STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENT OF 10.169% IN JUNEAU BIOSCIENCES, LLC (\\u201cJUNEAU\\u201d).   IN ADDITION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ASSAY AND RELATED SERVICES FOR THE PROGNOSIS AND MONITORING OF ENDOMETRIOSIS IN THE INFERTILITY MARKET WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LICENSED, JUNEAU IS DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF OTHER WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ISSUES.  THE COMPANY ISSUED 6,561,870 COMMON SHARES TO ACQUIRE LIFECODE AND HAS RECORDED THE ACQUISITION AS A PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT WITH A VALUATION SET AT $16,404,675.  A SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT WAS ENTERED INTO ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 THAT REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO ISSUE TO LIFECODE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT AN ADDITIONAL 5,718,372 SHARES.  USING THE OTC VALUE (DEFINED AS THE SHARE PRICE LISTED ON THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DEALER MARKETS AND NETWORKS) FOR THE ADDITIONAL SHARES ISSUED RESULTS IN AN INCREASE OF VALUE TO $30,700,605, AN INCREASE OF $14,295,930.  A VALUATION PERFORMED BY AN EXTERNAL OUTSIDE VALUATION EXPERT SUPPORTS A SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 VALUE OF $16,520,150 RESULTING IN A DAY ONE IMPAIRMENT OF $14,180,455.  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PURCHASE CONSIDERATION ISSUED TO THE SELLERS OF LIFECODE WAS ALLOCATED TO THE UNITS OF EQUITY ACQUIRED.  JUNEAU REPORTS TO ITS MEMBERS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS AND LIFECODE RECORDS ITS DISTRIBUTABLE SHARE OF SUCH REPORTED INCOME USING THE EQUITY METHOD.  SEC RULE 4-08(G) OF REGULATION S-X REQUIRES A REGISTRANT TO DISCLOSE, IN THE NOTES TO ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION OF ALL INVESTEES ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS, IF DEEMED SIGNIFICANT.

FISCAL 2017  REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS (NET) FOR FISCAL 2018 TOTALED $16,624,336 COMPARED TO $2,585,362 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASE OF $14,038,974 IS A RESULT OF AN EXPANSION OF OUR SALES FORCE AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS LEADING TO INCREASED SALES OF OUR HCT/PS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD (\\u201cCOGS\\u201d) INCLUDES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING, MANUFACTURE (INCLUDING MATERIAL AND DIRECT LABOR), PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION, SHIPPING, AND OTHER DIRECT EXPENSES RELATING TO OUR HCT/PS. OUR GROSS PROFIT DURING 2018 WAS $12,653,081 COMPARED TO $1,834,057 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASED GROSS PROFIT RESULTED FROM INCREASED SALES AND EFFICIENCIES INTRODUCED INTO OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES WERE $12,680,741 FOR FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO $1,897,543 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASED SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES RESULTED FROM CORRESPONDING INCREASES IN SALES, AS WELL AS $7.5M IN WARRANTS ISSUED TO SALES MANAGEMENT AS THEY MET PREDETERMINED MILESTONES BASED ON REVENUE GROWTH.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $1,896,092 FOR FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO $84,729 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES RESULTED FROM INCREASED FOCUS ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, STREAMLINING MANUFACTURING METHODS AND ADDITIONAL PROPRIETARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK PRIMARILY RELATING TO OUR HCT/PS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2018 WERE $5,827,891 COMPARED TO $946,754 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RESULTED FROM INCREASED MANAGEMENT HEADCOUNT AND WARRANTS ISSUED FOR CONSULTING RELATING TO ALL BUSINESS ENTITIES.  32  AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2018 WERE $4,573,534 COMPARED TO $3,693,579 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE EXPENSE OF COSTS RELATING TO OUR ACQUISITIONS  ON AUGUST 1, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE CONVERTIBLE, UNSECURED NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM JUNEAU FROM EXISTING NOTEHOLDERS IN EXCHANGE FOR STOCK OF THE COMPANY. THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS OWED ON SAID NOTES RECEIVABLE IS SUBJECT TO A SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY CREDITOR OF JUNEAU THAT IS OWED THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $700,000 PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST ON AN OBLIGATION THAT COMES DUE JULY 31, 2018. IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS EVENT, ON JUNE 15, 2017, AN AMENDMENT WAS ALSO MADE TO THE RESTATED AGREEMENT TO SUBORDINATE THE DEBT JUNEAU OWES TO PTG. THE FACE AMOUNT OF THE NOTES ACQUIRED WAS $2,870,380 AND 5,740,760 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED. THE NOTES BEAR INTEREST PAYABLE IN JUNEAU UNITS AT 12% AND ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO CLASS A UNITS OF JUNEAU AT THE RATE OF $1.00 PER UNIT. PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST ARE DUE IN A SINGLE INSTALLMENT ON AUGUST 1, 2018. UPON FURTHER REVIEW USING THE OTC VALUE AT THE DATE OF CLOSURE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A PRICE PER SHARE OF .78 CENTS WAS APPROXIMATE MARKET VALUE.  THEREFORE, THE VALUE OF THE SHARES GIVEN SHOULD BE $4,473,774, AN INCREASE OF $1,603,394. THIS DISCOUNT AT THE DATE OF THE SHARE TRANSFERS IS THEN CONSIDERED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE NOTES. THERE WAS NO CORRESPONDING IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN FISCAL 2018.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\\\" AND THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\\\"GAAP\\\").  THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS AFFECTING THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TOTAL COSTS ON LONG-TERM  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSTRUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS, COSTS TO BE INCURRED FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND EXTENDED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BAD DEBTS, EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, INCOME TAXES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND CONTINGENCIES.  OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  OVERVIEW  WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A WIDE RANGE OF DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  WE FOCUS OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS ON MARKETS, GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AND PRODUCTS.  OUR FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONSIST OF FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS AND THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  THE FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL, LIVE EVENTS, HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION, AND TRANSPORTATION, ALL OF WHICH INCLUDE THE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  DISCLOSURES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED IN \\\"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \\\" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  OUR NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY HISTORICALLY HAVE FLUCTUATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, SUCH AS DISPLAY SYSTEMS FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FACILITIES, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND SPECTACULAR PROJECTS IN THE COMMERCIAL AREA, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY OF THE SPORTS MARKET.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS CAN INCLUDE SEVERAL DISPLAYS, CONTROLLERS, AND SUBCONTRACTED STRUCTURE BUILDS, EACH OF WHICH CAN OCCUR ON VARIED SCHEDULES PER THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS.  OUTDOOR INSTALLATION SALES CAN BE IMPACTED BY OUTDOOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON.  OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER TENDS TO BE A SLOWER QUARTER BECAUSE IT INCLUDES TWO HOLIDAYS, IT IS AFFECTED BY SPORTS SEASONALITY, AND GENERALLY LESS OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION WORK OCCURS DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS.  OUR GROSS MARGINS TEND TO FLUCTUATE MORE ON UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS THAN ON LIMITED CONFIGURED ORDERS.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS INVOLVING COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND SUBSTANTIAL SUBCONTRACT WORK FOR PRODUCT INSTALLATION GENERALLY HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  ALTHOUGH WE FOLLOW THE OVER TIME METHOD OF RECOGNIZING REVENUES FOR UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, WE NEVERTHELESS HAVE EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS AND EXPECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FLUCTUATIONS.  OUR REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (\\\"BACKLOG\\\") CONSIST OF CONTRACTUALLY BINDING SALES AGREEMENTS OR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC DISPLAY SYSTEMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND EXCLUDE EXTENDED SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND SERVICE ONLY ORDERS.  ORDERS ARE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG WHEN WE ARE IN RECEIPT OF AN EXECUTED CONTRACT AND ANY REQUIRED DEPOSITS OR SECURITY.  AS A RESULT, CERTAIN ORDERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR CONTRACTS WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG UNTIL ALL REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS AND DEPOSITS ARE RECEIVED.  BACKLOG CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO LARGE ORDER BOOKINGS AND THE TIMING AND SEASONALITY OF NET SALES.  BECAUSE ORDER BACKLOG FLUCTUATES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXTENDED DELIVERY SCHEDULES, ORDERS MAY BE CANCELED AND HAVE VARIED ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY.  OUR BACKLOG IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE NET SALES OR NET INCOME.  GENERAL  OUR MISSION IS TO BE THE WORLD LEADER AT INFORMING AND ENTERTAINING AUDIENCES THROUGH DYNAMIC AUDIO-VISUAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.  WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS THROUGH ESTIMATED MARKET SHARE BASED ON ESTIMATED MARKET DEMAND FOR DIGITAL DISPLAYS AND GENERATING PROFITS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  OUR SUCCESS IS CONTINGENT ON THE DEPTH AND QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING RELATED CONTROL SYSTEMS, THE DEPTH OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS AND OUR TECHNOLOGY SERVING THESE MARKET DEMANDS.  THESE QUALITIES ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS BECAUSE OUR PRODUCTS HAVE FINITE LIFETIMES, AND WE STRIVE TO WIN REPLACEMENT BUSINESS FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS.  INCREASES IN USER ADOPTION, THE ACCEPTANCE OF A VARIETY OF DIGITAL SOLUTIONS, AND THE DECLINE OF DIGITAL SOLUTION PRICING OVER THE YEARS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE GLOBAL MARKET.  WITH THIS POSITIVE DEMAND, STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, WHICH CAUSES MARGIN CONSTRAINTS.  PROJECTS WITH MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR REVENUE POTENTIAL ALSO ATTRACT COMPETITION, WHICH GENERALLY REDUCES PROFITABILITY.  WE ORGANIZE AROUND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN \\\"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \\\" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT ALSO HAS UNIQUE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS AND CHALLENGES.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \\u2022  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCT MARKET GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH DRIVE MARKETPLACE EXPANSION.  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCTS ARE USED TO ATTRACT OR COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF RETAIL, COMMERCIAL, AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS.  PRICING AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR SUCCESS IN THIS BUSINESS UNIT.  WE UTILIZE A RESELLER NETWORK TO DISTRIBUTE OUR STANDARD PRODUCTS.  \\u2022  NATIONAL ACCOUNTS STANDARD DISPLAY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CUSTOMERS' DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR MESSAGE, ADVERTISING AND CONTENT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  INCREASED DEMAND IS POSSIBLE FROM RETAILERS, QUICK SERVE RESTAURANTS, PETROLEUM BUSINESSES, AND OTHER NATIONWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.  \\u2022  INCREASING INTEREST IN SPECTACULARS, WHICH INCLUDE VERY LARGE AND SOMETIMES HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED DISPLAYS AS PART OF ENTERTAINMENT VENUES SUCH AS CASINOS, SHOPPING CENTERS, CRUISE SHIPS AND TIMES SQUARE TYPE LOCATIONS.  \\u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS DEMAND GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND MARKETPLACE EXPANSION.  \\u2022  THE USE OF ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, WHICH REAL ESTATE OWNERS USE TO ADD ACCENTS OR EFFECTS TO AN ENTIRE SIDE OR CIRCUMFERENCE OF A BUILDING TO COMMUNICATE MESSAGES OR TO DECORATE THE BUILDING.  \\u2022  THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF DIGITAL BILLBOARDS AS OUT-OF-HOME (\\\"OOH\\\") ADVERTISING COMPANIES CONTINUE DEVELOPING NEW SITES AND REPLACING DIGITAL BILLBOARDS REACHING END OF LIFE.  THIS IS DEPENDENT ON NO ADVERSE CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE DIGITAL BILLBOARD REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RESTRICTING FUTURE BILLBOARD DEPLOYMENT, AS WELL AS MAINTAINING OUR CURRENT MARKET SHARE IN A BUSINESS THAT IS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW LARGE OOH COMPANIES.  \\u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \\u2022  FACILITIES SPENDING MORE ON LARGER DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE THE GAME-DAY AND EVENT EXPERIENCE FOR ATTENDEES.  \\u2022  LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, DRIVING AN EXPANSION OF THE MARKETPLACE.  \\u2022  OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, WHICH REMAIN THE MOST INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE OFFERINGS IN THE INDUSTRY.  \\u2022  THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF SPORTS TEAMS, WHICH STRIVE TO OUT-PERFORM THEIR COMPETITORS WITH DISPLAY SYSTEMS.  \\u2022  THE DESIRE FOR HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO DISPLAYS, WHICH TYPICALLY DRIVES LARGER DISPLAYS OR HIGHER RESOLUTION DISPLAYS, BOTH OF WHICH INCREASE THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION SIZE.  \\u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS NEEDS THROUGHOUT A SPORTS FACILITY.  \\u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \\u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR VIDEO SYSTEMS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALIZE THE REVENUE GENERATING POTENTIAL OF THESE DISPLAYS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL SCOREBOARDS.  \\u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISPLAYS AND DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MESSAGE CENTERS AT SCHOOLS TO COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS, PARENTS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY.  \\u2022  THE USE OF MORE SOPHISTICATED DISPLAYS IN SCHOOL ATHLETIC FACILITIES, SUCH AS LARGE INTEGRATED VIDEO SYSTEMS.  TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM INCREASING APPLICATIONS AND ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS TO MANAGE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ROADWAY, AIRPORT, PARKING, TRANSIT AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.  EFFECTIVE USE OF THE UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  THIS GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING, PRIMARILY BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, ALONG WITH THE CONTINUING ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE.  GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS FOR ADVERTISING AND WAY-FINDING USE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND AIRPORT TERMINALS.  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM ACHIEVING GREATER PENETRATION IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES AND BUILDING PRODUCTS MORE SUITED TO INDIVIDUAL MARKETS.  WE CONTINUE TO BROADEN OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE ALSO FOCUS ON SPORTS FACILITY, SPECTACULAR-TYPE, AND THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND THE FACTORS LISTED IN EACH OF THE OTHER BUSINESS UNITS TO THE EXTENT THEY APPLY OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS IS IMPACTED BY ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES.  THE EFFECTS OF AN ADVERSE ECONOMY ARE GENERALLY LESS SEVERE ON OUR SPORTS RELATED BUSINESS AS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, ALTHOUGH IN SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, THE SPORTS BUSINESS ALSO CAN BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED.  OUR COMMERCIAL AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNITS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN GENERAL.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COST TO MANUFACTURE AND THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE DECREASED OVER TIME AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN THE FUTURE.  AS A RESULT, EACH YEAR WE MUST SELL MORE PRODUCT TO GENERATE THE SAME OR GREATER LEVEL OF NET SALES AS IN PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS.  THIS PRICE DECLINE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT AS A RESULT OF INCREASED COMPETITION ACROSS ALL BUSINESS UNITS.  OUR ANNUAL REPORT DISCLOSES RISK FACTORS WE FACE, INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO GEOPOLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL CHANGES.  FOR FISCAL YEAR  2019  , WHILE WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT LONG-TERM GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL DISPLAY INDUSTRY, THE RECENT U.S. ADMINISTRATIVE TRADE ACTIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND SANCTIONS, AND RELATED REACTIONS AND RESPONSES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE VERY DYNAMIC.  THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS CREATED VOLATILITY, SUCH AS INCREASES IN PRICING OF AND DEMAND FOR ALUMINUM, ELECTRICAL, AND OTHER COMPONENTS WE USE IN OUR PRODUCTION.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND EVALUATE WAYS TO MINIMIZE THESE IMPACTS THROUGH VENDOR NEGOTIATIONS, ALTERNATIVE SOURCES, AND POTENTIAL PRICE ADJUSTMENTS.  WE ALSO EXPECT SOME OF THE MEASURES BEING CONTEMPLATED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS WILL CREATE MARKET REACTIONS AND WILL POSSIBLY HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT IN FUTURE QUARTERS.

WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FINANCED WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE USED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH BALANCES TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

AT  JANUARY 26, 2019  , WE HAD  $6.6 MILLION  OF BONDED WORK OUTSTANDING AGAINST THIS LINE.  OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES DEPEND ON INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: (I) CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY THE PER TON PRICE FOR CRUSHED CAR BODIES, AS WE BELIEVE THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES SOLD FOR SCRAP AND VEHICLES SOLD FOR DISMANTLING; (II) USED CAR PRICING, WHICH WE ALSO BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (III) THE MIX OF CARS SOLD; AND (IV) CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON AUCTION PARTICIPATION BY INTERNATIONAL BUYERS. WE CANNOT SPECIFICALLY QUANTIFY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT COMMODITY PRICING, USED CAR PRICING, AND PRODUCT SALES MIX HAS ON THE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES, OUR SERVICE REVENUES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPAIRS COSTS, USED CAR VALUES, AND AUCTION RETURNS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN OVERALL GROWTH IN THE SALVAGE MARKET DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN USED CAR VALUES RELATIVE TO REPAIR COSTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE GENERALLY TRENDING UPWARD. CONVERSELY, INCREASES IN USED CAR PRICES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING THE MOST RECENT RECESSION, MAY DECREASE TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH RATE. USED CAR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING USED CAR SUPPLY, WHICH IS TIED DIRECTLY TO NEW CAR SALES, AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD CONTINUED TO INCREASE, GROWING FROM 9.6 YEARS IN 2002 TO 12.1 YEARS IN 2018. THE FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR PRICING, AND AUCTION RETURNS ARE MANY AND VARIED AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THEIR MOVEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE TRENDS IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES.  YARD OPERATIONS EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OPERATING PERSONNEL (WHICH INCLUDES YARD MANAGEMENT, CLERICAL AND YARD EMPLOYEES), RENT, CONTRACT VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FUEL, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, AND COSTS OF VEHICLES SOLD UNDER THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING, SALES PERSONNEL, HUMAN RESOURCES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY INCLUDES INCOME FROM THE RENTAL OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, WHICH WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THESE ACTIVITIES EACH PERIOD. OTHER EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \\u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT.  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL IS CASH OPERATING RESULTS AND DEBT FINANCING. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING CASH OPERATING RESULTS ARE: (I) SEASONALITY; (II) MARKET WINS AND LOSSES; (III) SUPPLIER MIX; (IV) ACCIDENT FREQUENCY; (V) TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (VI) INCREASED VOLUME FROM OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS; (VII) COMMODITY PRICING; (VIII) USED CAR PRICING; (IX) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; (X) PRODUCT MIX; (XI) CONTRACT MIX TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; AND (XII) OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE FACTORS ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS SECTIONS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  POTENTIAL INTERNAL SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL ARE THE SALE OF ASSETS OR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES AND SHARES ISSUED UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. A POTENTIAL EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL IS THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT WITH NEW LENDERS AND EQUITY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT IF THESE SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE OR ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  24  ACQUISITIONS AND NEW OPERATIONS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL EXPANSION STRATEGY OF OFFERING INTEGRATED SERVICES TO VEHICLE SELLERS, WE ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING FACILITIES IN NEW REGIONS, AS WELL AS THE REGIONS CURRENTLY SERVED BY OUR FACILITIES.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WERE  20.4%  AND  28.5%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  21.8%  , AND  30.1%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTED OF BANK DEPOSITS, DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FUNDS INVESTED IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK, EQUITY ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT FINANCING. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS FROM THE COLLECTION OF SERVICE FEES AND REIMBURSABLE ADVANCES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF VEHICLE SALES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES FOR OUR REMAINING CASH BALANCES AND OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STOCK REPURCHASES, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND ACQUISITIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAIL, SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \\u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND  NOTE  8 \\u2013 STOCK REPURCHASES  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \\u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \\u201d AND \\u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \\u201d BELOW.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AS INCLEMENT WEATHER DURING THE WINTER MONTHS INCREASES THE FREQUENCY OF ACCIDENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, MOST OF OUR FACILITIES PROCESS 10% TO 30% MORE VEHICLES THAN AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR. THIS INCREASED VOLUME REQUIRES THE INCREASED USE OF OUR CASH TO PAY OUT ADVANCES AND HANDLING COSTS OF THE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS AND EXPAND SOME OF OUR CURRENT FACILITIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CASH THROUGH DRAWDOWNS ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO FUND THIS EXPANSION. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF GROWTH THROUGH EXPANSION AND ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE, THE OPENING OF NEW GREENFIELD YARDS IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE PROPERTY THAT (I) IS IN AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE A NEED FOR MORE CAPACITY; (II) HAS ADEQUATE SIZE GIVEN THE CAPACITY NEEDS; (III) HAS THE APPROPRIATE SHAPE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR OUR OPERATIONS; (IV) IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO A MAJOR ROAD OR HIGHWAY; AND (V) MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING FOR OUR BUSINESS. COSTS TO DEVELOP A NEW YARD CAN RANGE FROM $3.0 TO $50.0 MILLION, DEPENDING ON SIZE, LOCATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  ,  $69.4 MILLION  OF THE  $108.2 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., THE REPATRIATION OF THESE FUNDS COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX FOLLOWING THE U.S. TAX REFORM. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT REQUIRE REPATRIATION TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  9 \\u2013 INCOME TAXES  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING U.S. TAX REFORM AND ITS CORRESPONDING IMPACT ON FOREIGN CASH REPATRIATION.  NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO IMPROVED CASH OPERATING RESULTS FROM AN INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES AND VEHICLE SALES AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $31.6 MILLION DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, A DECREASE IN INVENTORY AND VEHICLE POOLING COSTS OF $22.8 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE OF $12.7 MILLION RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  30  NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEASE BUYOUTS OF CERTAIN FACILITIES, ACQUIRING LAND, OPENING AND IMPROVING FACILITIES, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR NEW SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE AND MAJOR SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS, AND ACQUIRING YARD EQUIPMENT. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, EXPAND AND INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES AND STANDARDIZE THE APPEARANCE OF EXISTING LOCATIONS.  NET CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AS PART OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL UNDER THE SUBHEADING \\\"  STOCK REPURCHASES  \\\" AND A DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET PROCEEDS FROM OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \\u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \\u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \\u201d, AND \\u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \\u201d.  CREDIT AGREEMENT  ON  DECEMBER 3, 2014  , WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, THE \\u201cCREDIT AMENDMENT\\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS SYNDICATION AGENT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR (A) A SECURED REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO  $300.0 MILLION  (THE \\u201cREVOLVING LOAN FACILITY\\u201d), AND (B) A SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $300.0 MILLION  (THE \\u201cTERM LOAN\\u201d), WHICH WAS FULLY DRAWN AT CLOSING. THE TERM LOAN AMORTIZED  $18.8 MILLION  PER QUARTER.  ON  MARCH 15, 2016  , WE ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cAMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDED CERTAIN TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF  DECEMBER 3, 2014  . THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR (A) AN INCREASE IN THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS BY  $50.0 MILLION  , BRINGING THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO  $350.0 MILLION  , (B) A NEW SECURED TERM LOAN (THE \\u201cINCREMENTAL TERM LOAN\\u201d) IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $93.8 MILLION  HAVING A MATURITY DATE OF  MARCH 15, 2021  , AND (C) AN EXTENSION OF THE TERMINATION DATE OF THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN FROM  DECEMBER 3, 2019  TO  MARCH 15, 2021  . THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT EXTENDED THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR THE TERM LOAN AND DECREASED THE QUARTERLY AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS FOR THAT LOAN TO  $7.5 MILLION  PER QUARTER. THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT ADDITIONALLY REDUCED THE PRICING LEVELS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO A RANGE OF  0.15%  TO  0.30%  IN THE CASE OF THE COMMITMENT FEE,  1.125%  TO  2.0%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, AND  0.125%  TO  1.0%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS, BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER. WE BORROWED THE ENTIRE  $93.8 MILLION  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN CONCURRENT WITH THE CLOSING OF THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT.  ON  JULY 21, 2016  , WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cSECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, SUNTRUST BANK, AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (AS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST TO WELLS FARGO BANK). THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDS CERTAIN TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 3, 2014 AS AMENDED BY THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF  MARCH 15, 2016  .

CONCURRENT WITH THE CLOSING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE PREPAID IN FULL THE OUTSTANDING  $242.5 MILLION  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN AND INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITHOUT PREMIUM OR PENALTY. THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT REDUCED THE PRICING LEVELS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO A RANGE OF  0.125%  TO  0.20%  IN THE CASE OF THE COMMITMENT FEE,  1.00%  TO  1.75%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, AND  0.0%  TO  0.75%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS, IN EACH CASE DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO. THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSES OF THESE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WERE TO INCREASE THE SIZE AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING. THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, OR OTHER INVESTMENTS RELATING TO OUR EXPANSION STRATEGIES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BEARS INTEREST, AT OUR ELECTION, AT EITHER (A) THE BASE RATE, WHICH IS DEFINED AS A FLUCTUATING RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE GREATEST OF (I) THE PRIME RATE IN EFFECT ON SUCH DAY; (II) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN EFFECT ON SUCH DATE PLUS  0.50%  ; OR (III) AN ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF A ONE-MONTH INTEREST PERIOD PLUS  1.0%  , IN EACH CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM  0.0%  TO  0.75%  BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER; OR (B) AN ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM  1.00%  TO  1.75%  DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER. INTEREST IS DUE AND PAYABLE QUARTERLY, IN ARREARS, FOR LOANS BEARING INTEREST AT THE BASE RATE, AND AT THE END OF AN INTEREST PERIOD (OR AT EACH THREE MONTH INTERVAL IN THE CASE OF LOANS WITH INTEREST PERIODS GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS) IN THE CASE OF LOANS BEARING INTEREST AT THE ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE. THE INTEREST RATE AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY WAS THE ONE MONTH  LIBOR RATE OF 2.50% PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 1.00%.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS COMPRISED OF BORROWINGS UNDER WHICH INTEREST ACCRUES UNDER A FLUCTUATING INTEREST RATE STRUCTURE. ACCORDINGLY, THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AND WAS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL II OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.  31  AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY  MAY BE REPAID AND REBORROWED UNTIL THE MATURITY DATE OF  JULY 21, 2021  . WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY A COMMITMENT FEE ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE DECREASE OF  $43 MILLION  IS PRIMARILY  DUE TO A PRIOR YEAR NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  \\\"SEGMENT INCOME\\\" WAS  $322 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  6%  , FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $305 MILLION  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  .  THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SHIPMENTS, FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, IMPROVED COST EFFICIENCIES AND FAVORABLE METAL COSTS.  FURTHER, THESE FACTORS DROVE NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO  $324 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,  AN IMPROVEMENT  OF  $97 MILLION  OVER THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  ON  JULY 26, 2018  , WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE ALERIS, A GLOBAL SUPPLIER OF ROLLED ALUMINUM PRODUCTS, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.6 BILLION  , INCLUDING A CASH PAYMENT OF $775 MILLION (SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS) PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF DEBT.  UPON CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTION, WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE ALERIS\\u2019 13 PRODUCTION FACILITIES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA.  WE HAVE SECURED FINANCING TO ACHIEVE CLOSURE OF THE ACQUISITION, WHICH CONTINUES TO PROGRESS AND IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2019 (SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020), SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS AND APPROVALS.  THE CONSUMMATION OF THE ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE PARTIES\\u2019 PERFORMANCE IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COVENANTS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE HART-SCOTT-RODINO WAITING PERIOD, THE RECEIPT OF APPROVALS UNDER THE COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) NO 139/2004 OF 20 JANUARY 2004, THE RECEIPT OF APPROVAL FROM THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN OTHER FOREIGN REGULATORY APPROVALS.  THE ACQUISITION IS NOT SUBJECT TO A FINANCING CONDITION.  WE HAVE OBTAINED FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION BY ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH A GROUP OF BANKS TO PROVIDE FINANCING.  FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, PLEASE REFER TO  NOTE 6 \\u2014 DEBT.  42  BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY CLIMATE  ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MATERIAL SUBSTITUTION CONTINUE TO DRIVE INCREASING GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ALUMINUM AND ROLLED PRODUCTS.  IN THE BEVERAGE CAN INDUSTRY, FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND INCREASING CUSTOMER PREFERENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING OPTIONS IS DRIVING HIGHER DEMAND FOR INFINITELY RECYCLABLE ALUMINUM BEVERAGE CANS AND BOTTLES.  IN NOVEMBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO EXPAND ROLLING AND RECYCLING CAPABILITY IN BRAZIL TO SUPPORT THIS DEMAND.  MEANWHILE, THE DEMAND FOR ALUMINUM IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY ALSO CONTINUES TO GROW, WHICH DROVE THE INVESTMENTS WE MADE IN OUR AUTOMOTIVE SHEET FINISHING CAPACITY IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA.  WE HAVE CONTINUED OUR AUTOMOTIVE EXPANSION EFFORTS WITH RECENT INVESTMENTS IN NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA.  THIS DEMAND HAS BEEN PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE BENEFITS THAT RESULT FROM USING LIGHTER WEIGHT MATERIALS IN VEHICLES, AS COMPANIES RESPOND TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, WHICH ARE DRIVING IMPROVED EMISSIONS AND BETTER FUEL ECONOMY; WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING VEHICLE SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE.

NEARLY ALL OF OUR FLAT-ROLLED PRODUCTS HAVE A PRICE STRUCTURE WITH THREE COMPONENTS: (I) A BASE ALUMINUM PRICE QUOTED OFF THE LME; (II) A LOCAL MARKET PREMIUM; AND (III) A \\u201cCONVERSION PREMIUM\\u201d TO PRODUCE THE ROLLED PRODUCT, WHICH REFLECTS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THAT PRODUCT.  BASE ALUMINUM PRICES ARE TYPICALLY DRIVEN BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AND GLOBAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF ALUMINUM.  THE LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS TEND TO VARY BASED ON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR METAL IN A PARTICULAR REGION AND ASSOCIATED TRANSPORTATION COSTS.  IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND SOUTH AMERICA, WE PASS THROUGH LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE RECORDED THROUGH \\\"NET SALES.\\\"  IN ASIA, WE PURCHASE OUR METAL INPUTS BASED ON THE LME AND INCUR A LOCAL MARKET PREMIUM; HOWEVER, MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS IN THIS REGION PRICE THEIR METAL USING THE SHANGHAI FUTURES EXCHANGE, WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE A LOCAL MARKET PREMIUM, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO FULLY PASS THROUGH THIS COMPONENT OF OUR METAL INPUT COST TO SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS.  LME BASE ALUMINUM PRICES AND LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS  THE AVERAGE (BASED ON THE SIMPLE AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY AVERAGES) AND CLOSING PRICES FOR ALUMINUM SET ON THE LME FOR THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  ARE AS FOLLOWS.

THE TIMING OF THESE IMPACTS VARIES BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND METAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH REGION.  THESE TIMING IMPACTS ARE REFERRED TO AS METAL PRICE LAG.  METAL PRICE LAG EXISTS DUE TO: (I) THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THE PRICING OF OUR PURCHASES OF METAL, HOLDING AND PROCESSING THE METAL, AND THE PRICING OF THE SALE OF FINISHED INVENTORY TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND (II) CERTAIN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS CONTAINING FIXED FORWARD PRICE COMMITMENTS WHICH RESULT IN EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN METAL PRICES FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN WHEN OUR SALES PRICE FIXES AND THE SALE ACTUALLY OCCURS.  WE USE LME ALUMINUM FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PRESERVE OUR CONVERSION MARGINS AND MANAGE THE TIMING DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LME BASE METAL COMPONENT OF \\u201cNET SALES,\\u201d AND \\u201cCOST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION).\\\"  THESE DERIVATIVES DIRECTLY HEDGE THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUTURE LME BASE METAL PRICE FLUCTUATIONS TO BETTER MATCH THE PURCHASE PRICE OF METAL WITH THE SALES PRICE OF METAL.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR LOCAL MARKET PREMIUM HEDGING OCCURS IN NORTH AMERICA; HOWEVER, THE EXPOSURE IS NOT FULLY HEDGED.  IN OUR EUROPE AND ASIA REGIONS, THE DERIVATIVE MARKET FOR LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS IS NOT ROBUST OR EFFICIENT ENOUGH FOR US TO OFFSET THE IMPACTS OF LMP PRICE MOVEMENTS BEYOND A SMALL VOLUME.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, VOLATILITY IN LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  44  WE ELECT TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO BETTER MATCH THE RECOGNITION OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH THE RECOGNITION OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  FOR UNDESIGNATED METAL DERIVATIVES, THERE ARE TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVES AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  THE RECOGNITION OF UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON UNDESIGNATED METAL DERIVATIVE POSITIONS TYPICALLY PRECEDES INVENTORY COST RECOGNITION, CUSTOMER DELIVERY AND REVENUE RECOGNITION.  THE TIMING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON UNDESIGNATED METAL DERIVATIVES AND COST OR REVENUE RECOGNITION IMPACTS \\u201c  INCOME TAX PROVISION  \\u201d AND \\u201c  NET INCOME  .\\u201d  GAINS AND LOSSES ON METAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d UNTIL REALIZED.  SEE  SEGMENT REVIEW  BELOW FOR THE IMPACT OF METAL PRICE LAG ON EACH OF OUR SEGMENTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY AND RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITIES  WE OPERATE A GLOBAL BUSINESS AND CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AROUND THE WORLD.  WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AS FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS WE TRANSLATE THE OPERATING RESULTS FROM VARIOUS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES INTO OUR U.S. DOLLAR REPORTING CURRENCY AT THE CURRENT AVERAGE RATES.  WE ALSO RECORD FOREIGN EXCHANGE REMEASUREMENT GAINS AND LOSSES WHEN BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THAT OPERATION.

IN EUROPE, WHERE WE HAVE PREDOMINANTLY LOCAL CURRENCY SELLING PRICES AND OPERATING COSTS, WE BENEFIT AS THE EURO STRENGTHENS, BUT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS THE EURO WEAKENS. IN SOUTH KOREA, WHERE WE HAVE LOCAL CURRENCY OPERATING COSTS AND U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SELLING PRICES FOR EXPORTS, WE BENEFIT AS THE WON WEAKENS BUT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS THE WON STRENGTHENS.  IN BRAZIL, WHERE WE HAVE PREDOMINATELY U.S. DOLLAR SELLING PRICES AND LOCAL CURRENCY MANUFACTURING COSTS, WE BENEFIT AS THE REAL WEAKENS, BUT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS THE REAL STRENGTHENS.

THE \\\"ELIMINATIONS\\\" COLUMN ADJUSTS REGIONAL \\\"SEGMENT INCOME\\\" FOR INTERSEGMENT SHIPMENTS THAT OCCUR IN A PERIOD PRIOR TO RECOGNITION OF \\\"SEGMENT INCOME\\\" ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  THE \\\"ELIMINATIONS\\\" COLUMN ALSO REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN REGIONAL VOLUME, CONVERSION PREMIUM AND PRODUCT MIX, AND CONVERSION COSTS RELATED TO INTERSEGMENT SHIPMENTS FOR CONSOLIDATION.  (B)  \\\"SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT COSTS\\\" INCLUDE COSTS INCURRED DIRECTLY BY EACH SEGMENT AND ALL CORPORATE RELATED COSTS.  NORTH AMERICA  \\u201cNET SALES\\u201d  INCREASED  $554 MILLION  , OR  19%  , DUE TO HIGHER AUTOMOTIVE AND CAN SHIPMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CUSTOMER DEMAND.  \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d WAS  $395 MILLION  , AN  INCREASE  OF  13%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER VOLUME AND FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX AND PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION EFFORTS.  THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  EUROPE  \\u201cNET SALES\\u201d  DECREASED  $2 MILLION  , OR LESS THAN  1%  , MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER SPECIALTY SHIPMENTS RESULTING FROM OUR DECISION TO CEASE PRODUCTION OF LITHOGRAPHIC MATERIALS IN THE PRIOR YEAR IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AS WELL AS LOWER AUTOMOTIVE SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CAN SHIPMENTS.  \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d WAS  $170 MILLION  , AN  INCREASE  OF  8%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COST EFFICIENCIES AND FAVORABLE METAL MIX.  THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CAN PRICING AND LOWER VOLUMES.  ASIA  \\u201cNET SALES\\u201d  INCREASED  $59 MILLION  , OR  4%  , DUE TO HIGHER AUTOMOTIVE SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPECIALTY SHIPMENTS.  \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d WAS  $151 MILLION  , AN  INCREASE  OF  22%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE METAL COSTS AND SCRAP SPREADS, INCREASED COST EFFICIENCY AND FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACT AND LOWER SHIPMENTS.  SOUTH AMERICA  \\u201cNET SALES\\u201d  INCREASED  $190 MILLION  , OR  13%  , DUE TO HIGHER CAN SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPECIALTY SHIPMENTS.  \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d WAS  $295 MILLION  , AN  INCREASE  OF  10%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE METAL MIX AND SCRAP SPREADS, HIGHER VOLUME AND FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CAN PRICING AND HIGHER SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  51  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS WERE FUNDED THROUGH CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS AND A COMBINATION OF LOCAL FINANCING AND OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  MOST OF OUR RECENT STRATEGIC EXPANSION PROJECTS ARE OPERATING CLOSE TO FULL CAPACITY AND ARE GENERATING ADDITIONAL OPERATING CASH FLOW.  WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO FUND OUR CONTINUED EXPANSIONS, SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: THE GENERATION OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS; OUR EXISTING DEBT FACILITIES, INCLUDING REFINANCING; AND NEW DEBT ISSUANCES, AS NECESSARY.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCTION FOOTPRINT IN THE U.S. WITH AN APPROXIMATE  $300 MILLION  INVESTMENT IN AUTOMOTIVE FINISHING CAPACITY IN GUTHRIE, KENTUCKY.  ADDITIONALLY, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INVEST  $180 MILLION  TO DOUBLE OUR AUTOMOTIVE FINISHING CAPACITY AT OUR EXISTING PLANT IN CHANGZHOU, CHINA AND IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ARE INVESTING  $175 MILLION  TO EXPAND OUR ROLLING AND RECYCLING CAPACITY AT OUR PINDA PLANT IN BRAZIL.  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PENDING ACQUISITION OF ALERIS, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMITMENT LETTER WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER WHICH SUCH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE UP TO $775 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL TERM LOANS AND UP TO $1.5 BILLION OF SHORT TERM LOANS.  ON DECEMBER 18, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AN INCREASE JOINDER AMENDMENT (THE \\u201cTERM LOAN INCREASE JOINDER AMENDMENT\\u201d) TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S EXISTING SECURED TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED BY THE TERM LOAN INCREASE JOINDER AMENDMENT, THE \\u201cAMENDED SECURED TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d) AND A SHORT TERM CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cSHORT TERM CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d). THE TERM LOAN INCREASE JOINDER AMENDMENT GOVERNS THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED COMMITMENTS OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE UP TO $775 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL TERM LOANS UNDER OUR EXISTING TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE SHORT TERM CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNS THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED COMMITMENTS OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE UP TO $1.5 BILLION OF SHORT TERM LOANS. THE LENDERS\\u2019 COMMITMENTS TO ADVANCE THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOANS AND THE SHORT TERM LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE CONCURRENT CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF ALERIS AND THE PRIOR AMENDMENT OF THE AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR EXISTING ABL REVOLVER TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PERMIT THE BORROWING OF THE NEW LOANS.  SEE  NOTE 6 \\u2014 DEBT  FURTHER DETAILS.  NON-GUARANTOR INFORMATION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY\\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE NOT GUARANTORS REPRESENTED THE FOLLOWING APPROXIMATE PERCENTAGES OF (A) \\\"NET SALES\\\", (B) ADJUSTED EBITDA (SEGMENT INCOME), AND (C) \\\"TOTAL ASSETS\\\" OF THE COMPANY, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS (INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY BALANCES).  ITEM DESCRIPTION  RATIO  NET SALES REPRESENTED BY NET SALES TO THIRD PARTIES BY NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES (FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018)  20%  ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTED BY NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES (FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018)  13%  ASSETS OWNED BY NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES (AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018)  17%  IN ADDITION, FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , THE COMPANY\\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE NOT GUARANTORS HAD NET SALES OF  $2.1 BILLION  AND $2.1 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND, AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THOSE SUBSIDIARIES HAD ASSETS OF  $2.1 BILLION  AND DEBT AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF  $1.4 BILLION  (INCLUDING INTER-COMPANY BALANCES).  AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY  OUR AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  IS AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

THE  DECREASE  IN TOTAL AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS OF  $239 MILLION  FOR THE ACQUISITION OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY THAT WE HISTORICALLY LEASED AT OUR SIERRE, SWITZERLAND ROLLING FACILITY, A REDUCTION IN CREDIT FACILITY LINES OF  $127 MILLION  , NET PAYMENTS ON SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS OF  $71 MILLION  AND OTHER CHANGES OF  $4 MILLION  , CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACTS ON CASH.  THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY POSITIVE FREE  52  CASH FLOW OF  $127 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  IN THE ABL BORROWING BASE OF  $75 MILLION  AND SALE OF ASSETS OF  $2 MILLION  .  SEE  NOTE 6 \\u2014 DEBT  FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT OUR AVAILABILITY UNDER COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.  THE \\u201cCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\\u201d BALANCE ABOVE INCLUDES CASH HELD IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HELD  $5 MILLION  OF \\\"CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\\\" IN CANADA, IN WHICH WE ARE INCORPORATED, WITH THE REST HELD IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HELD  $248 MILLION  OF CASH IN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE HAVE ASSERTED THAT EARNINGS ARE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO FUND OPERATIONS AND LOCAL EXPANSIONS WITH CASH HELD IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.  OUR SIGNIFICANT FUTURE USES OF CASH INCLUDE FUNDING OUR EXPANSION PROJECTS GLOBALLY, WHICH WE PLAN TO FUND WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND LOCAL FINANCING, AND SERVICING OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS DOMESTICALLY, WHICH WE PLAN TO FUND WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND, IF NECESSARY, BY REPATRIATING CASH FROM JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT ASSERTED THAT EARNINGS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.  CASH HELD OUTSIDE OF CANADA IS FREE FROM SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THE CASH FROM BEING ACCESSED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDING, IF NECESSARY, TO FUND OPERATIONS AND SERVICE DEBT OBLIGATIONS IN CANADA.  UPON THE REPATRIATION OF ANY EARNINGS TO CANADA, IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CANADIAN INCOME TAXES (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR FOREIGN TAXES PAID AND THE UTILIZATION OF THE LARGE CUMULATIVE NET OPERATING LOSSES WE HAVE IN CANADA) AND WITHHOLDING TAXES PAYABLE TO THE VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE DO NOT BELIEVE ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXIST THAT RESTRICT OUR USE OF \\u201cCASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS\\u201d IN A MATERIAL MANNER.  FREE CASH FLOW  REFER TO \\\"NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\\\" FOR OUR DEFINITION OF \\\"FREE CASH FLOW\\\".  THE FOLLOWING TABLE DISPLAYS THE \\u201cFREE CASH FLOW\\u201d FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , THE CHANGE BETWEEN PERIODS, AS WELL AS THE ENDING BALANCES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (IN MILLIONS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  2017  CHANGE  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $324  $227  $97  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (434  )  180  (614  )  PLUS: CASH USED IN THE ACQUISITION OF ASSETS UNDER A CAPITAL LEASE  239  \\u2014  239  LESS: PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS AND BUSINESS, NET OF TRANSACTION FEES, CASH INCOME TAXES AND HEDGING  (2  )  (304  )  302  FREE CASH FLOW (A)  $127  $103  $24  ENDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $797  $757  $40  _________________________  (A)  EFFECTIVE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, MANAGEMENT CLARIFIED THE DEFINITION OF \\\"FREE CASH FLOW\\\" (A NON-GAAP MEASURE) TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CASH OUTFLOWS RELATED TO THE \\\"ACQUISITION OF ASSETS UNDER A CAPITAL LEASE\\\".  THIS CHANGE FURTHER ENABLES USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO UNDERSTAND CASH GENERATED INTERNALLY BY THE COMPANY.  THIS CHANGE DOES NOT IMPACT THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR PRIOR PERIODS REPORTED.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  WAS  $324 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WHICH WAS  FAVORABLE  COMPARED TO NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $227 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  .  THE  FAVORABLE  VARIANCE PRIMARILY RELATES TO HIGHER \\\"SEGMENT INCOME\\\" PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TAXES PAID AND RISING METAL PRICES WHICH WE MANAGE THROUGH WORKING CAPITAL INITIATIVES.  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER QUANTITIES OF INVENTORY AND OUR FACTORING OF RECEIVABLES.  HEDGING ACTIVITIES  WE USE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISK AS WELL AS LIQUIDITY.  UNDER OUR TERMS OF CREDIT WITH COUNTERPARTIES TO OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL MARGIN CALL EXPOSURE.  NO MATERIAL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN POSTED BY NOVELIS NOR DO WE HOLD ANY MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF MARGIN POSTED BY OUR COUNTERPARTIES.  WE SETTLE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN ADVANCE OF BILLING ON THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL INVENTORY AND COLLECTING PAYMENT FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH TEMPORARILY IMPACTS OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.  THE LAG BETWEEN DERIVATIVE SETTLEMENT AND CUSTOMER COLLECTION TYPICALLY RANGES FROM 30 TO 90 DAYS.  MORE DETAILS ON OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN BE FOUND ABOVE IN \\u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  .\\\"  53  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \\\"  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \\\" WAS  $434 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AS COMPARED TO \\\"  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \\\" OF  $180 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  .  THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY THAT WE HISTORICALLY LEASED AT OUR SIERRE, SWITZERLAND ROLLING FACILITY FROM CONSTELLIUM FOR  $239 MILLION  .  ADDITIONALLY, IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, WE RECEIVED \\\"  PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF A BUSINESS  \\\" IN THE AMOUNT OF  $314 MILLION  DUE TO THE SALE OF SHARES IN ULSAN ALUMINUM LTD.  THE DECREASE IS ALSO PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL SPENDING DUE TO NEW INVESTMENTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THERE WERE NO ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.  WE MADE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF  $77 MILLION  ON KOREAN LONG-TERM DEBT,  $14 MILLION  ON OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY,  $3 MILLION  ON CAPITAL LEASES AND  $1 MILLION  OF OTHER REPAYMENTS.  THE NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITIES' BALANCE IS RELATED TO PROCEEDS OF  $92 MILLION  ON OUR ABL REVOLVER AND  $17 MILLION  ON OUR CHINA CREDIT FACILITIES.  WE INCURRED  $2 MILLION  IN COSTS AS A RESULT OF FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS IN ANTICIPATION OF OUR PENDING ALERIS ACQUISITION.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  , THERE WERE NO ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.  WE MADE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF  $50 MILLION  ON SHORT-TERM LOANS IN BRAZIL,  $14 MILLION  ON OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY,  $68 MILLION  ON KOREAN LONG-TERM DEBT AND  $6 MILLION  ON CAPITAL LEASES.  THE NET CASH REPAYMENTS FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITIES BALANCE IS RELATED TO PAYMENTS OF  $119 MILLION  ON OUR ABL REVOLVER AND  $21 MILLION  ON OUR CHINA CREDIT FACILITIES.  54  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC RULES, THE FOLLOWING QUALIFY AS OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  \\u2022  ANY OBLIGATION UNDER CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS;  \\u2022  ANY OBLIGATION UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEES OR CONTRACTS;  \\u2022  A RETAINED OR CONTINGENT INTEREST IN ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY OR SIMILAR ENTITY OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT THAT SERVES AS CREDIT, LIQUIDITY OR MARKET RISK SUPPORT TO THAT ENTITY FOR SUCH ASSETS; AND  \\u2022  ANY OBLIGATION UNDER A MATERIAL VARIABLE INTEREST HELD BY THE REGISTRANT IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY THAT PROVIDES FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE REGISTRANT, OR ENGAGES IN LEASING, HEDGING OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES WITH THE REGISTRANT.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES THE APPLICABLE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS FOR OUR COMPANY.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  SEE  NOTE 10 \\u2014 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS  TO OUR ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.  GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS  WE HAVE ISSUED GUARANTEES ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  THE INDEBTEDNESS GUARANTEED IS FOR TRADE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  SOME OF THE GUARANTEES HAVE ANNUAL TERMS WHILE OTHERS HAVE NO EXPIRATION AND HAVE TERMINATION NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.  NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HOLDS ANY ASSETS OF ANY THIRD PARTIES AS COLLATERAL TO OFFSET THE POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT OF THESE GUARANTEES.  SINCE WE CONSOLIDATE WHOLLY-OWNED AND MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH TRADE PAYABLES AND SHORT-TERM DEBT FACILITIES FOR THESE ENTITIES ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  SEE  NOTE 5 \\u2014 INVESTMENT IN AND ADVANCES TO NON-CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  FOR DETAILS ON OUR GUARANTEE OF INDEBTEDNESS TO ALUNORF, OUR NON-CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE.  OTHER ARRANGEMENTS  FACTORING OF TRADE RECEIVABLES  WE FACTOR AND FORFAIT TRADE RECEIVABLES (COLLECTIVELY, WE REFER TO THESE AS \\\"FACTORING\\\" PROGRAMS) BASED ON LOCAL CASH NEEDS, AS WELL AS ATTEMPTING TO BALANCE THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS OF TRADE PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES, FUND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, AND FUND OTHER BUSINESS NEEDS.  FACTORED INVOICES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WHEN WE DO NOT RETAIN A FINANCIAL OR LEGAL INTEREST.  IF A FINANCIAL OR LEGAL INTEREST IS RETAINED, WE CLASSIFY THESE FACTORINGS AS SECURED BORROWINGS.  HOWEVER, NO SUCH FINANCIAL OR LEGAL INTERESTS ARE CURRENTLY RETAINED.  OTHER  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS, WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT GENERATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE ARE NOT INVOLVED IN ANY UNCONSOLIDATED SPE TRANSACTIONS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER VARIOUS CONTRACTS RELATING TO DEBT AND INTEREST PAYMENTS, CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES, LONG-TERM PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  SEE  NOTE 6 \\u2014 DEBT  TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND \\\"CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\\\" OF THE MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  FOR MORE DETAILS.  RETURN OF CAPITAL  PAYMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDER ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY OUR BUSINESS, OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, BEING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPROPRIATE INDENTURES AND COVENANTS UNDER THE INSTRUMENTS THAT GOVERN OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE DISCLOSED IN  NOTE 1 \\u2014 BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS REPORTED IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE  NOTE 1 \\u2014 BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS INCLUDING THE RESPECTIVE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION AND EXPECTED EFFECTS ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  55  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d PRESENTS THE SUM OF THE RESULTS OF OUR FOUR OPERATING SEGMENTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  WE BELIEVE THAT TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d IS AN OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT MEASURES OPERATING RESULTS UNAFFECTED BY DIFFERENCES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURES, CAPITAL INVESTMENT CYCLES AND AGES OF RELATED ASSETS AMONG OTHERWISE COMPARABLE COMPANIES. IN REVIEWING OUR CORPORATE OPERATING RESULTS, WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO REVIEW THE AGGREGATE CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE OF ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS ON THE SAME BASIS WE REVIEW THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF OUR REGIONS AND TO DRAW COMPARISONS BETWEEN PERIODS BASED ON THE SAME MEASURE OF CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES INVESTORS\\u2019 UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERFORMANCE IS ENHANCED BY INCLUDING THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR COMPARING OUR ONGOING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  MANY INVESTORS ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS BY COMPARING OUR RESULTS FROM ONGOING OPERATIONS FROM ONE PERIOD TO THE NEXT AND WOULD ORDINARILY ADD BACK ITEMS THAT ARE NOT PART OF NORMAL DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS.  BY PROVIDING TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME,\\u201d TOGETHER WITH RECONCILIATIONS, WE BELIEVE WE ARE ENHANCING INVESTORS\\u2019 UNDERSTANDING OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS ASSISTING INVESTORS IN EVALUATING HOW WELL WE ARE EXECUTING STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.  HOWEVER, TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d IS NOT A MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER U.S. GAAP, AND OUR TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.  TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d HAS IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER U.S. GAAP.  FOR EXAMPLE, TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d.  \\u2022  DOES NOT REFLECT THE COMPANY\\u2019S CASH EXPENDITURES OR REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS;  \\u2022  DOES NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN, OR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR, THE COMPANY\\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS; AND  \\u2022  DOES NOT REFLECT ANY COSTS RELATED TO THE CURRENT OR FUTURE REPLACEMENT OF ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED.  WE ALSO USE TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d.  \\u2022  AS A MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE TO ASSIST US IN COMPARING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE IMPACT OF ITEMS NOT DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM OUR CORE OPERATIONS;  \\u2022  FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR INTERNAL ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGETS AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS;  \\u2022  TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES; AND  \\u2022  AS A BASIS TO CALCULATE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYMENTS FOR OUR KEY EMPLOYEES.  TOTAL \\u201cSEGMENT INCOME\\u201d IS EQUIVALENT TO OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH WE REFER TO IN OUR EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENTS AND OTHER EXTERNAL PRESENTATIONS TO ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS.  \\u201cFREE CASH FLOW\\u201d CONSISTS OF: (A) \\u201cNET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES,\\u201d (B) PLUS \\\"NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES\\u201d (C) PLUS CASH USED IN THE \\u201cACQUISITION OF ASSETS UNDER A CAPITAL LEASE\\u201d, AND (D) LESS \\u201cPROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS AND BUSINESS, NET OF TRANSACTION FEES, CASH INCOME TAXES AND HEDGING\\u201d.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES \\u201cFREE CASH FLOW\\u201d IS RELEVANT TO INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES A MEASURE OF THE CASH GENERATED INTERNALLY THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DEBT SERVICE AND OTHER VALUE CREATION OPPORTUNITIES.  MANAGEMENT ALSO USES FREE CASH FLOW TO MEASURE THE PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, \\u201cFREE CASH FLOW\\u201d DOES NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, AS CERTAIN DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS MUST BE FUNDED OUT OF \\u201cFREE CASH FLOW.\\u201d OUR METHOD OF CALCULATING \\u201cFREE CASH FLOW\\u201d MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF OTHER COMPANIES.  56  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND MARKET DATA  THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AND BELIEFS AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY OUR MANAGEMENT.

(2)  CONSISTS OF TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.  THE INCREASE IN ASSETS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, GAS IN STORAGE AND BROKER MARGIN AT ENERGY SERVICES, INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, UNBILLED REVENUE AND UTILITY PLANT AT OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT AND INCREASED SOLAR ASSETS AT CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  OUR MANAGEMENT USES NFE, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WHEN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  ENERGY SERVICES  ECONOMICALLY HEDGES ITS NATURAL GAS INVENTORY WITH FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. NFE IS A MEASURE OF THE EARNINGS BASED ON ELIMINATING TIMING DIFFERENCES SURROUNDING THE RECOGNITION OF CERTAIN GAINS OR LOSSES, TO EFFECTIVELY MATCH THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC HEDGES WITH THE PHYSICAL SALE OF GAS AND, THEREFORE, ELIMINATES THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY TO GAAP EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THERE IS A RELATED TAX EFFECT ON CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE CORRESPONDING WITH THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE TAX EFFECT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT AND RESULTING REVALUATION OF THE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES THAT AROSE FROM DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITY AS MEASURED UNDER NFE. THE REVALUATION CAUSED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON RECONCILING ITEMS TO DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY RATE IN EFFECT. TO THE EXTENT WE UTILIZE FORWARDS, FUTURES, OR OTHER DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE FORECASTED SREC PRODUCTION, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ALSO ELIMINATED FOR NFE PURPOSES.  GAAP REQUIRES US, DURING THE INTERIM PERIODS, TO ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND USE THIS RATE TO CALCULATE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX PROVISION. WE ALSO DETERMINE AN ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR NFE PURPOSES AND CALCULATE A QUARTERLY TAX ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR FORECASTED NET INCOME AND OUR FORECASTED NFE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. SINCE THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON CERTAIN FORECASTED ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES SURROUNDING COMPLETION OF CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES PROJECTS, THE RATE AND RESULTING NFE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. NO ADJUSTMENT IS NEEDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, SINCE THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS CALCULATED AT YEAR END.  35  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2.

THE  DECREASE  IN NFE DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED WITH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  , WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INCOME TAX  BENEFIT OF  $57.6 MILLION  ASSOCIATED WITH  THE REVALUATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAXES RESULTING FROM THE TAX ACT DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  ,  THAT DID NOT RECUR DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,  AND LOW  ER FINANCIAL MARGIN GENERATED AT ENERGY SERVICES DUE PRIMARILY TO NARROWER PRICING SPREADS AND LESS PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS MARKET.  NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT  OVERVIEW  OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF NJNG, A NATURAL GAS UTILITY THAT PROVIDES REGULATED RETAIL NATURAL GAS SERVICE IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN NEW JERSEY TO APPROXIMATELY  543,800  RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN ITS SERVICE TERRITORY AND ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY RELEASE MARKETS. THE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS, WHICH CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT CUSTOMER GROWTH, OPERATING AND FINANCING COSTS, FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES AND CUSTOMER CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CUSTOMER USAGE, CERTAIN REGULATORY ACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS. IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF EVENTS OR TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS.  36  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  IN ADDITION,  NJNG  \\u2019  S  BUSINESS IS SEASONAL BY NATURE, AS WEATHER CONDITIONS DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE VOLUME OF NATURAL GAS DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. SPECIFICALLY, CUSTOMER DEMAND SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES DURING THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN NATURAL GAS IS USED FOR HEATING PURPOSES. AS A RESULT, NJNG RECEIVES MOST OF ITS NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION REVENUES DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND FISCAL QUARTERS AND IS SUBJECT TO VARIATIONS IN EARNINGS AND WORKING CAPITAL DURING THE YEAR.  AS A REGULATED COMPANY, NJNG IS REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY DECISIONS ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE  NOTE 4. REGULATION  IN THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION ON REGULATORY ACTIONS, INCLUDING FILINGS RELATED TO PROGRAMS AND ASSOCIATED EXPENDITURES, AS WELL AS RATE REQUESTS RELATED TO RECOVERY OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.  NJNG  \\u2019  S  OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE, GROWING ITS CUSTOMER BASE, DIVERSIFYING ITS GROSS MARGIN, PROMOTING CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS AND MITIGATING THE RISKS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS  NJNG HAS SIGNIFICANT ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, INCLUDING NEW UTILITY PLANT ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER GROWTH AND ITS ASSOCIATED PIPELINE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS. BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF NJNG\\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING ACCRUALS, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AND ESTIMATES OF EXPECTED INVESTMENTS FOR  FISCAL 2019  AND  2020  .  ESTIMATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE REVIEWED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND MAY VARY BASED ON THE ONGOING EFFECTS OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, UNFORESEEN EVENTS AND THE ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL.  SAFE II AND NJ RISE  NJNG CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT BPU-APPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF NJNG'S GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.  THE BPU APPROVED THE 5-YEAR SAFE II PROGRAM AND THE ASSOCIATED RATE MECHANISM, TO REPLACE THE REMAINING UNPROTECTED STEEL MAINS AND SERVICES FROM NJNG\\u2019S NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $200 MILLION  , EXCLUDING AFUDC. THE ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY METHODOLOGY FOR THE  $157.5 MILLION  ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTENSION OF SAFE II WAS APPROVED IN NJNG\\u2019S BASE RATE CASE. THE REMAINING  $42.5 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE REQUESTED FOR RECOVERY IN FUTURE BASE RATE CASES.  37  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  THE BPU APPROVED NJNG'S NJ RISE CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM, WHICH CONSISTS OF SIX CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROJECTS ESTIMATED TO COST  $102.5 MILLION  , EXCLUDING AFUDC, FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION STORM HARDENING AND MITIGATION PROJECTS, ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. THESE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO MINIMIZE SERVICE IMPACTS DURING EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS TO CUSTOMERS IN THE MOST STORM-PRONE AREAS OF NJNG\\u2019S SERVICE TERRITORY. RECOVERY OF NJ RISE INVESTMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NJNG\\u2019S BASE RATES.  IN  SEPTEMBER 2018  , THE BPU APPROVED NJNG\\u2019S ANNUAL PETITION REQUESTING A BASE RATE INCREASE OF  $6.8 MILLION  FOR THE RECOVERY OF SAFE II AND NJ RISE CAPITAL INVESTMENT COSTS RELATED TO THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WITH A WEIGHTED COST OF CAPITAL OF  6.9 PERCENT  INCLUDING A RETURN ON EQUITY OF  9.75 PERCENT  , EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 1, 2018.  SOUTHERN RELIABILITY LINK  THE SRL IS AN APPROXIMATELY 30-MILE, 30-INCH TRANSMISSION MAIN DESIGNED TO SUPPORT IMPROVED SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND INTEGRITY IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF NJNG\\u2019S SERVICE TERRITORY, ESTIMATED TO COST BETWEEN  $190 MILLION  AND  $225 MILLION  . ALL APPROVALS ISSUED BY STATE AGENCIES ARE UNDER APPEAL AND CERTAIN ROAD-OPENING PERMITS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SECURED. CONSTRUCTION BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2018, WITH AN ESTIMATED IN-SERVICE DATE IN EARLY  2020.  CUSTOMER GROWTH  IN CONDUCTING NJNG'S BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON FACTORS IT BELIEVES MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON ITS FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS. NJNG'S POLICY IS TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, REGULATORS AND POLICYMAKERS, TO ACHIEVE FAVORABLE RESULTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE RATE OF NJNG'S CUSTOMER GROWTH IN ITS SERVICE TERRITORY, WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL AND REGULATORY POLICIES, THE DELIVERED COST OF NATURAL GAS COMPARED WITH COMPETING FUELS, INTEREST RATES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS. NJNG'S TOTAL CUSTOMERS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  DECEMBER 31,  2018  DECEMBER 31,  2017  FIRM CUSTOMERS  RESIDENTIAL  478,983  463,679  COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL & OTHER  29,640  28,656  RESIDENTIAL TRANSPORT  25,559  31,969  COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT  9,540  10,089  TOTAL FIRM CUSTOMERS  543,722  534,393  OTHER  39  49  TOTAL CUSTOMERS  543,761  534,442  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY, NJNG ADDED  2,934  AND  2,637  NEW CUSTOMERS AND CONVERTED  53  AND  113  EXISTING CUSTOMERS TO NATURAL GAS HEAT AND OTHER SERVICES. NJNG EXPECTS THESE NEW CUSTOMER ADDITIONS, AND THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO ADDED ADDITIONAL NATURAL GAS SERVICES TO THEIR PREMISES TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY  $1.6 MILLION  ANNUALLY TO UTILITY GROSS MARGIN.  NJNG EXPECTS TO ADD APPROXIMATELY  28,000  TO  30,000  NEW CUSTOMERS DURING THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  TO  2021  . BASED ON INFORMATION FROM MUNICIPALITIES AND DEVELOPERS, AS WELL AS EXTERNAL INDUSTRY ANALYSTS AND MANAGEMENT'S EXPERIENCE, NJNG ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY  65 PERCENT  OF THE GROWTH WILL COME FROM NEW CONSTRUCTION MARKETS AND  35 PERCENT  FROM CUSTOMER CONVERSIONS TO NATURAL GAS FROM OTHER FUEL SOURCES. THIS NEW CUSTOMER AND CONVERSION GROWTH WOULD INCREASE UTILITY GROSS MARGIN UNDER NJNG'S BASE RATES BY APPROXIMATELY  $5.3 MILLION  ANNUALLY, AS CALCULATED UNDER NJNG'S CIP TARIFF.

MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  ON  DECEMBER 18, 2018  , THE BPU APPROVED A DECREASE IN NJNG'S EE RECOVERY RATE REFLECTING COSTS INCURRED THROUGH  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN ANNUAL DECREASE OF  $8.8 MILLION  , EFFECTIVE  JANUARY 1, 2019.  SINCE INCEPTION,  $165.7 MILLION  IN GRANTS, REBATES AND LOANS HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS, WITH A TOTAL ANNUAL RECOVERY OF APPROXIMATELY  $16.1 MILLION  . THE RECOVERY INCLUDES A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT RANGES FROM  6.69 PERCENT  TO  7.76 PERCENT  , WITH A RETURN ON EQUITY OF  9.75 PERCENT  TO  10.3 PERCENT.  CONSERVATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM/BGSS  THE CIP FACILITATES NORMALIZING NJNG\\u2019S UTILITY GROSS MARGIN FOR VARIANCES NOT ONLY DUE TO WEATHER BUT ALSO FOR OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING CUSTOMER USAGE, SUCH AS CONSERVATION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. RECOVERY OF UTILITY GROSS MARGIN FOR THE NON-WEATHER VARIANCE THROUGH THE CIP IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF CERTAIN GAS SUPPLY COST SAVINGS ACHIEVED AND IS SUBJECT TO A VARIABLE MARGIN REVENUE TEST. ADDITIONALLY, RECOVERY OF THE CIP UTILITY GROSS MARGIN IS SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL EARNINGS TEST. AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE CIP MUST BE FILED BY JUNE 1, COINCIDENT WITH NJNG\\u2019S ANNUAL BGSS FILING, DURING WHICH NJNG CAN REQUEST RATE CHANGES TO THE CIP. IN MAY 2014, THE BPU APPROVED THE CONTINUATION OF THE CIP PROGRAM WITH NO EXPIRATION DATE.  NJNG'S TOTAL UTILITY FIRM GROSS MARGIN INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE CIP MECHANISM.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  (THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  WEATHER  (1)  $(1,468  )  $(1,368  )  USAGE  (1,940  )  642  TOTAL  $(3,408  )  $(726  )  (1)  COMPARED WITH THE CIP 20-YEAR AVERAGE, WEATHER WAS  4.7 PERCENT  AND  0.1 PERCENT  COLDER  -THAN-NORMAL DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY.  RECOVERY OF NATURAL GAS COSTS  NJNG\\u2019S COST OF NATURAL GAS IS PASSED THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WITHOUT MARKUP, BY APPLYING NJNG\\u2019S AUTHORIZED BGSS RATE TO ACTUAL THERMS DELIVERED. THERE IS NO UTILITY GROSS MARGIN ASSOCIATED WITH BGSS COSTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN SUCH COSTS DO NOT IMPACT NJNG\\u2019S EARNINGS. NJNG MONITORS ITS ACTUAL GAS COSTS IN COMPARISON TO ITS BGSS RATES TO MANAGE ITS CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ALLOWED RECOVERY OF NATURAL GAS COSTS, WHICH IS FACILITATED THROUGH BPU-APPROVED DEFERRED ACCOUNTING AND THE BGSS PRICING MECHANISM. ACCORDINGLY, NJNG OCCASIONALLY ADJUSTS ITS PERIODIC BGSS RATES OR CAN ISSUE CREDITS OR REFUNDS, AS APPROPRIATE, FOR ITS RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS WHEN THE COMMODITY COST VARIES FROM THE EXISTING BGSS RATE. BGSS RATES FOR ITS LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS ARE ADJUSTED MONTHLY BASED ON NYMEX PRICES.  IN  SEPTEMBER 2018  , THE BPU PROVISIONALLY APPROVED NJNG\\u2019S ANNUAL PETITION TO MAINTAIN ITS BGSS RATE FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND INCREASE ITS BALANCING CHARGE RATE, RESULTING IN A  $10.3 MILLION  INCREASE TO THE ANNUAL REVENUES CREDITED TO BGSS, AS WELL CHANGES TO THE CIP RATES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A  $30.9 MILLION  ANNUAL RECOVERY DECREASE, EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 1, 2018  . THE BALANCING CHARGE RATE INCLUDES THE COST OF BALANCING NATURAL GAS DELIVERIES WITH CUSTOMER USAGE FOR SALES AND TRANSPORTATION CUSTOMERS AND BALANCING CHARGE REVENUES ARE CREDITED TO BGSS. THERE WERE NO BILL CREDITS ISSUED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO BGSS PRICES.  ON  DECEMBER 28, 2018  , NJNG NOTIFIED THE BPU THAT IT WILL IMPLEMENT A BGSS INCREASE OF FIVE PERCENT TO A TYPICAL CUSTOMER\\u2019S BILL EFFECTIVE  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  , WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN REVENUES CREDITED TO BGSS OF  $10.9 MILLION  THROUGH  SEPTEMBER 2019.  BGSS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS  NJNG IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR REDUCING BGSS COSTS THROUGH A SERIES OF UTILITY GROSS MARGIN-SHARING PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE OFF-SYSTEM SALES, CAPACITY RELEASE AND STORAGE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE BETTER UTILIZATION AND HEDGING OF NJNG\\u2019S NATURAL GAS SUPPLY, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE ASSETS. DEPENDING ON THE PROGRAM, NJNG SHARES 80 OR 85 PERCENT OF UTILITY GROSS MARGIN GENERATED BY THESE PROGRAMS WITH FIRM CUSTOMERS. UTILITY GROSS MARGIN FROM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WAS  $2 MILLION  AND  $4.4 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY.  39  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  HEDGING  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RELATIVE PRICE STABILITY TO ITS NATURAL GAS SUPPLY PORTFOLIO, NJNG EMPLOYS A HEDGING STRATEGY WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING AT LEAST 75 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S PROJECTED WINTER PERIODIC BGSS GAS SALES VOLUMES HEDGED BY EACH NOVEMBER 1 AND AT LEAST 25 PERCENT OF THE PROJECTED PERIODIC BGSS GAS SALES HEDGED FOR THE FOLLOWING APRIL THROUGH MARCH PERIOD. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING FUTURES, SWAPS AND OPTIONS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMMODITY AND/OR WEATHER-RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITY.  COMMODITY PRICES  OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT IS AFFECTED BY THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS, WHICH CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, SHORT-TERM FINANCING COSTS, THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS CHARGED TO OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE BGSS CLAUSE, OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WHICH IMPACTS OUR BAD DEBT EXPENSE, AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER FUEL SOURCES.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES UTILITY GROSS MARGIN, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WHEN EVALUATING THE OPERATING RESULTS OF NJNG. NJNG'S UTILITY GROSS MARGIN IS DEFINED AS NATURAL GAS REVENUES LESS NATURAL GAS PURCHASES, SALES TAX, AND REGULATORY RIDER EXPENSES, AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE DEFINITION OF GROSS MARGIN USED BY OTHERS IN THE NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT UTILITY GROSS MARGIN PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL BASIS FOR EVALUATING UTILITY OPERATIONS SINCE NATURAL GAS COSTS, SALES TAX AND REGULATORY RIDER EXPENSES ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING REVENUE AND PASSED THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NO EFFECT ON UTILITY GROSS MARGIN. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY USES NFE, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WHEN EVALUATING THE OPERATING RESULTS OF CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES. GAAP REQUIRES US, DURING THE INTERIM PERIODS, TO ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND USE THIS RATE TO CALCULATE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX PROVISION. WE ALSO DETERMINE AN ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR NFE PURPOSES AND CALCULATE A QUARTERLY TAX ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR FORECASTED NET INCOME AND OUR FORECASTED NFE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. THIS ADJUSTMENT IS APPLIED TO CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES, AS SUCH ADJUSTMENT IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAX CREDITS GENERATED BY CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES. NO ADJUSTMENT IS NEEDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, SINCE THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS CALCULATED AT YEAR END. ACCORDINGLY, FOR NFE PURPOSES, THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS  (13) PERCENT  FOR  FISCAL 2019  AND  16.3 PERCENT  FOR  FISCAL 2018.  46  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2.

ENERGY SERVICES MAINTAINS A STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO OF NATURAL GAS STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS THAT IT UTILIZES IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS MARKET EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND VALUE TO ITS CUSTOMERS. AVAILABILITY OF THESE STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS ALLOWS ENERGY SERVICES TO GENERATE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES BY CAPTURING PRICE DIFFERENTIALS OVER SPECIFIC TIME HORIZONS AND BETWEEN GEOGRAPHIC MARKET LOCATIONS.  ENERGY SERVICES ALSO PROVIDES MANAGEMENT OF STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION ASSETS FOR NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS AND REGULATED UTILITIES. THESE MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS TYPICALLY INVOLVE THE RELEASE OF PRODUCER/UTILITY OWNED STORAGE AND/OR TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY IN COMBINATION WITH EITHER AN OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE AND/OR DELIVER PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTUAL PURCHASE AND/OR SALE OF PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS, ENERGY SERVICES GENERATES OR PAYS FEE-BASED MARGIN IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AND MAY PROVIDE THE PRODUCER AND/OR UTILITY WITH ADDITIONAL MARGIN BASED ON ACTUAL RESULTS.  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THESE CONTRACTS, ENERGY SERVICES GENERATES FINANCIAL MARGIN BY IDENTIFYING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERING INTO NATURAL GAS PURCHASE/SALE, STORAGE OR TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. IN CASES WHERE STORAGE IS UTILIZED TO FULFILL THESE CONTRACTS, THESE FORECAST SALES AND/OR PURCHASES ARE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED THROUGH THE USE OF FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES, OPTIONS AND SWAP CONTRACTS, AND ARE FREQUENTLY USED TO LOCK IN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONAL CASH FLOWS AND TO HELP MANAGE VOLATILITY IN NATURAL GAS MARKET PRICES. GENERALLY, WHEN ITS STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS ARE EXPOSED TO PERIODS OF INCREASED MARKET VOLATILITY, ENERGY SERVICES IS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO CAPTURE MARGIN BY IMPROVING THE RESPECTIVE TIME OR GEOGRAPHIC SPREADS ON A FORWARD BASIS.  ENERGY SERVICES ACCOUNTS FOR ITS PHYSICAL COMMODITY CONTRACTS AND ITS FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ON THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITY CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING REVENUE OR GAS PURCHASES ON THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. VOLATILITY IN REPORTED NET INCOME AT ENERGY SERVICES CAN OCCUR OVER PERIODS OF TIME DUE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS TIMING DIFFERENCES RELATED TO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES CAN FLUCTUATE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS, SRECS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FROM THE ORIGINAL TRANSACTION PRICE. VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS CAN ALSO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SETTLEMENT OF FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES AND THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL COMMODITY. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT SETTLES AND THE PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS IS INJECTED INTO INVENTORY, THE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, THE GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS UNTIL THE NATURAL GAS INVENTORY IS WITHDRAWN FROM STORAGE AND SOLD, AT WHICH TIME ENERGY SERVICES REALIZES THE ENTIRE MARGIN ON THE TRANSACTION.  47  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES FINANCIAL MARGIN AND NFE, NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHEN EVALUATING THE OPERATING RESULTS OF  ENERGY SERVICES. FINANCIAL MARGIN AND NFE ARE BASED ON REMOVING TIMING DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THERE IS A RELATED TAX EFFECT ON CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE CORRESPONDING WITH NFE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE TAX EFFECT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT AND RESULTING REVALUATION OF THE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES THAT AROSE FROM DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITY AS MEASURED UNDER NFE. THE REVALUATION CAUSED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON RECONCILING ITEMS TO DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY RATE IN EFFECT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  MANAGEMENT VIEWS THESE MEASURES AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OVERALL EXPECTED ECONOMIC RESULT AND USES THESE MEASURES TO COMPARE ENERGY SERVICES' RESULTS AGAINST ESTABLISHED BENCHMARKS AND EARNINGS TARGETS AS THESE MEASURES ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY ON GAAP EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF TIMING DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE UNANTICIPATED IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE RELATED TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ECONOMIC HEDGES, ENERGY SERVICES' ACTUAL NON-GAAP RESULTS CAN DIFFER FROM THE RESULTS ANTICIPATED AT THE OUTSET OF THE TRANSACTION. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.  WHEN ENERGY SERVICES RECONCILES THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BOTH FINANCIAL MARGIN AND NFE, THE CURRENT PERIOD UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES ARE EXCLUDED AS A RECONCILING ITEM. FINANCIAL MARGIN AND NFE ALSO EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC HEDGING OF THE VALUE OF OUR NATURAL GAS IN STORAGE AND, THEREFORE, ONLY INCLUDE REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO NATURAL GAS WITHDRAWN FROM STORAGE, EFFECTIVELY MATCHING THE FULL EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE DERIVATIVES WITH REALIZED MARGINS ON THE RELATED PHYSICAL GAS FLOWS.

AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY  17.1 MILLION  OF THOSE SHARES AND MAY REPURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL  2.4 MILLION  SHARES UNDER THE APPROVED PROGRAM. THERE WERE  NO  SHARES REPURCHASED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017.  DEBT  NJR AND ITS UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY RELY ON CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE UTILIZATION OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO MEET WORKING CAPITAL AND SHORT-TERM DEBT FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. NJNG ALSO RELIES ON THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER FOR SHORT-TERM FUNDING. NJR AND NJNG PERIODICALLY ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND LONG-LIFE ASSETS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING BORROWING AVAILABILITY, EQUITY PROCEEDS AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES' WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. NJR, NJNG, CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES AND ENERGY SERVICES CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT EACH OF THEIR FINANCING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE MET PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY, INCLUDING PROCEEDS FROM OUR DRP AND INCLUDING UTILIZING THE WAIVER DISCOUNT FEATURE.

THE SEASONAL NATURE OF NJNG'S OPERATIONS CREATES LARGE SHORT-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS, PRIMARILY TO FINANCE NATURAL GAS PURCHASES AND CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. NJNG OBTAINS WORKING CAPITAL FOR THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND FOR THE TEMPORARY FINANCING OF CONSTRUCTION AND MGP REMEDIATION EXPENDITURES AND ENERGY TAX PAYMENTS, BASED ON ITS FINANCIAL PROFILE, THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER SUPPORTED BY THE NJNG CREDIT FACILITY OR THROUGH SHORT-TERM BANK LOANS UNDER THE NJNG CREDIT FACILITY.

OPERATING CASH FLOWS ARE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY VARIATIONS IN WORKING CAPITAL, WHICH CAN BE IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \\u2022  SEASONALITY OF OUR BUSINESS;  \\u2022  FLUCTUATIONS IN WHOLESALE NATURAL GAS PRICES AND OTHER ENERGY PRICES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN DERIVATIVE ASSET AND LIABILITY VALUES;  \\u2022  TIMING OF STORAGE INJECTIONS AND WITHDRAWALS;  \\u2022  THE DEFERRAL AND RECOVERY OF GAS COSTS;  \\u2022  CHANGES IN CONTRACTUAL ASSETS UTILIZED TO OPTIMIZE MARGINS RELATED TO NATURAL GAS TRANSACTIONS;  \\u2022  BROKER MARGIN REQUIREMENTS;  \\u2022  IMPACT OF UNUSUAL WEATHER PATTERNS ON OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS;  \\u2022  TIMING OF THE COLLECTIONS OF RECEIVABLES AND PAYMENTS OF CURRENT LIABILITIES;  \\u2022  VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS PURCHASED AND SOLD; AND  \\u2022  TIMING OF SREC DELIVERIES.  THE INCREASE OF  $81.3 MILLION  IN CASH FLOWS USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED WITH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  , WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER FINANCIAL MARGIN GENERATED AT ENERGY SERVICES, DECREASED BASE RATES AT NJNG DUE TO A LOWER FEDERAL TAX RATE AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, ALONG WITH HIGHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED GAS IN STORAGE.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED  $93.7 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED WITH  $76.9 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  . THE  INCREASE  OF  $16.8 MILLION  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES OF  $12.4 MILLION  AND  $13.7 MILLION  FOR UTILITY PLANT AND SOLAR, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ADVANCE PAYMENT OF  $10 MILLION  FOR THE IEC ACQUISITION THAT OCCURRED DURING FISCAL 2018.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING CASH FLOWS GENERALLY ARE SEASONAL IN NATURE AND ARE IMPACTED BY THE VOLATILITY IN PRICING IN THE NATURAL GAS AND OTHER ENERGY MARKETS. NJNG'S INVENTORY LEVELS ARE BUILT UP DURING ITS NATURAL GAS INJECTION SEASON (APRIL THROUGH OCTOBER) AND REDUCED DURING WITHDRAWAL SEASON (NOVEMBER THROUGH MARCH) IN RESPONSE TO THE SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS OF ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE LOUISIANA LIGHT SWEET (\\\"LLS\\\") OIL PRICE PREMIUM AT DELHI INCREASED TO $5.03 PER BARREL RESULTING IN A HIGHER REALIZED OIL PRICE PREMIUM OVER THE NYMEX OIL PRICE.  \\u2022  TOTAL PRODUCTION (BOE'S) GREW 2% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR QUARTER.  \\u2022  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1.3 MILLION FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER, A 4% DECREASE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR QUARTER AND A 24% DECREASE FROM THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER.  \\u2022  WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED 12% TO  $30.8 MILLION  COMPARED TO YEAR-AGO QUARTER END AND WE REMAIN DEBT FREE.  DELHI FIELD - ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT  GROSS OIL PRODUCTION AT DELHI AVERAGED 6,772 BOPD DURING THE QUARTER, A 2.8% INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER.  GROSS NGL PRODUCTION FOR QUARTER WAS 983 BOEPD, DOWN 2.9% FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER. OIL PRODUCTION IMPROVED QUARTER OVER QUARTER AS WE SAW PRODUCTION FROM SIX OF THE NEW INFILL WELLS AS COMPARED TO FIVE IN THE PRIOR QUARTER. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THE SEVENTH INFILL WELL WILL BE PUT ON PRODUCTION EARLY, AND THE REMAINING TWO INFILL WELLS TO BE PUT ON PRODUCTION LATE, IN THE QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31, 2019. IN ADDITION, THE OPERATOR ADDED A THIRD WORKOVER RIG IN THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER WITH POSITIVE RESULTS WHICH ALSO HELPED TO IMPROVE PRODUCTION. TWO OF THE INFILL INJECTION WELLS COMMENCED INJECTING CO  2  , CONTRIBUTING TO AN OVERALL INCREASE IN FIELD INJECTION VOLUMES FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER. WE EXPECT TO SEE FUTURE IMPROVEMENT IN OFFSET WELLS AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK. THE OPERATOR CONTINUES TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE PLANT EFFICIENCY AND MINIMIZE UNPLANNED DOWNTIMES. WE EXPECT TO SEE IMPROVED NGL RATES THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK.  DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER, WE INCURRED $1.3 MILLION ON CAPITAL PROJECTS AT DELHI, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH, OR $0.7 MILLION, WAS SPENT COMPLETING THE DRILLING OF A WATER INJECTION WELL, A WATER SOURCE WELL AND COMPLETING THE WATER FACILITIES IN PREPARATION FOR PHASE V EXPANSION OF THE FLOOD.  ADDITIONALLY, $0.3 MILLION WAS EXPENDED ON WORKOVERS AND CONFORMANCE PROJECTS, $0.2 MILLION ON NGL PLANT IMPROVEMENTS AND $0.1 MILLION FOR THE INFILL DRILLING PROGRAM.  THE CURRENT EXPECTATION FOR NET CAPITAL SPENDING FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 IS UP TO $1.0 MILLION FOR THE ONGOING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN ADVANCE OF PHASE V, THE NEXT AREA OF FIELD DEVELOPMENT, AND VARIOUS CONFORMANCE AND WORKOVER PROJECTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE OPERATOR WILL CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIELD THROUGH PHASE V IN OUR FISCAL YEAR 2020. THE OPERATOR HAS NOT YET ANNOUNCED THEIR CAPITAL BUDGET FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2019.  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, OPERATING REVENUES WERE $11.0 MILLION, BASED ON AN AVERAGE REALIZED OIL PRICE OF $64.37 PER BARREL AND AN AVERAGE REALIZED NGL PRICE OF $22.46 PER BOE,AND WE GENERATED $4.7 MILLION IN INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  THE DECLINE IN NGL REALIZED PRICES IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FALL IN OIL PRICES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER TOGETHER WITH THE DELHI OPERATOR\\u2019S ONGOING FIXED, PER BARREL POST PRODUCTION COST ALLOCATION TO THE FIELD\\u2019S ROYALTY AND MINERAL INTERESTS WHICH REDUCES OUR REVENUE FROM SUCH INTERESTS. THIS EARNINGS EFFECT IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LEASE OPERATING EXPENSE FOR OUR DELHI WORKING INTEREST WHICH SHARES IN RECOVERED POST PRODUCTION COSTS. IN THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER, OPERATING REVENUES WERE $10.9 MILLION AND WE HAD INCOME FROM OPERATIONS OF $4.8 MILLION, BASED ON AN AVERAGE REALIZED OIL PRICE OF $57.30 PER BARREL AND AN AVERAGE REALIZED NGL PRICE OF $28.45 PER BOE.  NET PRODUCTION VOLUMES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WERE 2,034 BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT PER DAY (\\u201cBOEPD\\u201d), UP FROM THE 1,992 BOEPD IN THE PRIOR QUARTER AND  DOWN FROM THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER\\u2019S 2,215 BOEPD. NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER WAS $3.9 MILLION, OR $0.12 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $5.8 MILLION, OR $0.17 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER AND $9.9 MILLION, OR $0.30 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER.

OUR INTERESTS IN THE DELHI FIELD CONSIST OF A 23.9% WORKING INTEREST (WITH ASSOCIATED 19.0% NET REVENUE INTEREST) AND SEPARATE OVERRIDING ROYALTY AND MINERAL  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTERESTS OF 7.2%. THIS YIELDS A TOTAL NET REVENUE INTEREST OF 26.2%. THE FIELD IS OPERATED BY DENBURY ONSHORE LLC, A SUBSIDIARY OF DENBURY RESOURCES, INC. (THE \\\"OPERATOR\\\").  PRODUCTION COSTS IN THE DELHI FIELD WERE $3.5 MILLION IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, DOWN LESS THAN 1% FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER DESPITE A 10% INCREASE IN PURCHASED CO  2  VOLUMES, LARGELY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CO  2  COST PER MCF.  PURCHASED CO  2  VOLUMES INCREASED 10% COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS QUARTER AND YEAR-AGO QUARTER TO 76.3 MILLION CUBIC FEET (MMCF) PER DAY DUE TO COMPLETION OF INJECTION WELLS ADDED IN THE 2018 INFILL DRILLING PROGRAM. CO  2  COSTS WERE 19% HIGHER THAN THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER DUE TO A 12% HIGHER OIL PRICE TO WHICH CO  2  PRICES ARE LINKED AND THE INCREASE IN PURCHASED CO  2  VOLUMES.  FOR  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , CO  2  COSTS INCREASED DUE TO A 21% INCREASE IN PRICE PER MCF, WHICH REFLECTED THE HIGHER REALIZED OIL PRICE AT DELHI, TOGETHER WITH A 5% INCREASE IN PURCHASED VOLUMES. THE INCREASE IN OTHER PRODUCTION COSTS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NGL PLANT COSTS, ELECTRICITY AND FUEL COSTS, INCREASED CHEMICALS AND LABOR, IMPACTED IN MANY CASES BY THE INCREASED NUMBER OF WORKOVER PROJECTS AND THE ADDITIONAL INFILL WELLS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  REVENUES  COMPARED TO THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER, CURRENT QUARTER REVENUES INCREASED SLIGHTLY DUE TO  10%  HIGHER REALIZED COMMODITY PRICES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN  8%  DECREASE IN PRODUCTION VOLUMES.

THE BENEFIT OF THE LOWER STATUTORY RATE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASED BENEFIT FROM DEPLETION IN EXCESS OF BASIS AS MUCH OF OUR DEPLETION CARRYOVER HAD BEEN UTILIZED BY JUNE 30, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAD  $30.0 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (AND NO RESTRICTED CASH) AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  $27.7 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH AT JUNE 30, 2018.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A SENIOR SECURED RESERVE-BASED CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\\"FACILITY\\\") WITH A MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF $50 MILLION.  THE FACILITY HAD $40 MILLION OF UNDRAWN BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY ON  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THERE HAVE BEEN NO BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITY, WHICH MATURES ON APRIL 11, 2021 AND IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ASSETS.  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, WE AMENDED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO BROADEN THE DEFINITION FOR USE OF PROCEEDS TO PROVIDE FUNDS, LIMITED TO AN AMOUNT NOT IN EXCESS OF 25% OF THE BORROWING BASE, FOR INVESTMENTS INTO CASH FLOW GENERATING ASSETS COMPLIMENTARY TO THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS.  ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS BEAR INTEREST, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AT EITHER LIBOR PLUS 2.75% OR THE PRIME RATE, AS DEFINED UNDER THE FACILITY, PLUS 1.0%. THE FACILITY CONTAINS COVENANTS THAT REQUIRE THE MAINTENANCE OF (I) A TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO OF NOT MORE THAN 3.0 TO 1.0, (II) A DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO OF NOT LESS THAN 1.1 TO 1.0 AND (III) A CONSOLIDATED TANGIBLE NET WORTH OF NOT LESS THAN $50.0 MILLION, EACH AS DEFINED IN THE FACILITY. THE FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS OTHER CUSTOMARY AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE FACILITY.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE FUNDED OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CASH DIVIDENDS WITH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS RESULTING IN AN INCREASE OF  $2.3 MILLION  IN CASH.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS  $30.8 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $3.1 MILLION  OVER WORKING CAPITAL OF  $27.7 MILLION  AT JUNE 30, 2018.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND WORKING CAPITAL. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH IS THE SALE OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PRODUCTION. A PORTION OF THESE CASH FLOWS ARE USED TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WHILE WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EXPEND CAPITAL TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE DELHI FIELD, WE AND THE OPERATOR HAVE FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHEN THIS CAPITAL IS SPENT. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MANAGE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE DELHI FIELD WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF ITS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND EXISTING WORKING CAPITAL.  WE MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE NEW GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION TO OUR CASH ON HAND, WE HAVE ACCESS TO AT LEAST $40 MILLION OF UNDRAWN ELECTED BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY. IN ADDITION WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UNDER WHICH WE MAY ISSUE UP TO $500 MILLION OF NEW DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES. IF WE CHOOSE TO PURSUE NEW GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, WE WOULD EXPECT TO USE OUR INTERNAL RESOURCES OF CASH, WORKING CAPITAL AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY. IT MAY ALSO BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR US TO CONSIDER ISSUING ADDITIONAL EQUITY AS PART OF ANY POTENTIAL TRANSACTION, BUT WE HAVE NO SPECIFIC PLANS TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY AT THIS TIME.  OUR OTHER SIGNIFICANT USE OF CASH IS OUR ON-GOING DIVIDEND PROGRAM. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INSTITUTED A CASH DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK IN DECEMBER 2013 AND WE HAVE SINCE PAID TWENTY-ONE CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS. DISTRIBUTION OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF FREE CASH FLOW IN EXCESS OF OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THROUGH CASH DIVIDENDS AND POTENTIAL REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK REMAINS A PRIORITY OF OUR FINANCIAL STRATEGY, AND IT IS OUR LONG TERM GOAL TO INCREASE OUR DIVIDENDS OVER TIME AS APPROPRIATE. ON FEBRUARY 5, 2019, THE BOARD DECLARED THE NEXT QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND OF $0.10 PER SHARE, WHICH WILL BE PAID ON MARCH 29, 2019 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD ON MARCH 15, 2019. THE BOARD REVIEWS THE  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE IN LIGHT OF OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATIONS, FORECASTED RESULTS, INCLUDING THE OUTLOOK FOR OIL AND NGL PRICES, THE TIMING OF FURTHER EXPANSION OF DELHI DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER POTENTIAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.  CAPITAL BUDGET - DELHI FIELD  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE INCURRED  $4.0 MILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DELHI. OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS FOR NET CAPITAL SPENDING FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 IS UP TO TO $1.0 MILLION FOR CONTINUATION OF PHASE V INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND VARIOUS CONFORMANCE AND WORKOVER PROJECTS, WHICH REPRESENT CARRYOVER PROJECTS APPROVED FROM 2018.  THE OPERATOR HAS NOT YET ANNOUNCED THEIR CAPITAL BUDGET PLANS FOR 2019, HOWEVER WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING FOR OUR SHARE OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AT DELHI TO BE MET FROM CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES AT JUNE 30, 2018 INCLUDED 537 MBOE OF RESERVES AND $1.9 MILLION OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INFILL DRILLING PROGRAM AND 1,546 MBOE OF RESERVES AND $10.9 MILLION OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PHASE V DEVELOPMENT IN THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE FIELD. THE TIMING OF PHASE V DEVELOPMENT IS DEPENDENT IN PART ON THE RESULTS AND CO  2  REQUIREMENTS OF THE INFILL DRILLING PROGRAM. THE TIMING OF SUCH DEVELOPMENT IS ALSO DEPENDENT, IN PART, ON THE FIELD OPERATOR'S AVAILABLE FUNDS AND CAPITAL SPENDING PLANS AND PRIORITIES WITHIN ITS PORTFOLIO OF PROPERTIES.  AT PRESENT, WE EXPECT TO BEGIN THIS DEVELOPMENT IN OUR FISCAL YEAR 2020.  FUNDING FOR OUR ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DELHI FOR OUR FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE MET FROM CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND CURRENT WORKING CAPITAL.

THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD NON-CASH ITEMS USED, RATHER THAN PROVIDED CASH, BECAUSE OF A ONE-TIME  $6.0 MILLION  DEFERRED INCOME TAX CREDIT RELATED TO ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUT AND JOBS ACT.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED  $4.0 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURE DISBURSEMENTS IN THE 2019 PERIOD.  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED  $1.4 MILLION  DUE TO  $1.7 MILLION  OF INCREASED CASH DIVIDENDS, REFLECTING AN HIGHER QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE OF $0.10 PER SHARE IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO $0.075 PER SHARE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $0.3 MILLION  OF LOWER COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES IN CONNECTION WITH STOCK-BASED AWARDS VESTINGS.

OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS  INFLATION  .  ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL INFLATION RATE IN THE UNITED STATES, AS MEASURED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX, HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT YEARS, THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED UNUSUALLY VOLATILE PRICE MOVEMENTS IN COMMODITY PRICES, VENDOR GOODS AND OILFIELD SERVICES. PRICES FOR DRILLING AND OILFIELD SERVICES, OILFIELD EQUIPMENT, TUBULARS, LABOR, EXPERTISE AND OTHER SERVICES IMPACT OUR LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES AND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. DURING FISCAL 2019 TO DATE, WE HAVE SEEN A FIRMING OF PRICES FOR OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF IMPROVING DEMAND AND A CLOSER BALANCE WITH THE SUPPLY OF GOODS AND SERVICES IN THE INDUSTRY. PRODUCT PRICES, OPERATING COSTS AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS MAY NOT ALWAYS MOVE IN TANDEM.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES  .  GENERAL WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FOR THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY, CONTINUE TO BE UNCERTAIN AND VOLATILE. CONCERNS OVER UNCERTAIN FUTURE ECONOMIC GROWTH ARE AFFECTING NUMEROUS INDUSTRIES AND COMPANIES, AS WELL AS CONSUMERS, WHICH IMPACT DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. IF THE SUPPLY OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXCEEDS DEMAND IN THE FUTURE, IT MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, THEREBY LOWERING OUR REVENUES, PROFITS, CASH FLOW AND WORKING CAPITAL GOING FORWARD.  SEASONALITY  .  OUR BUSINESS IS GENERALLY NOT DIRECTLY SEASONAL, EXCEPT FOR INSTANCES WHEN WEATHER CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ACCESS TO OUR PROPERTIES OR DELIVERY OF OUR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

OVERVIEW  EGAIN IS AN INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE-AS-A SERVICE (SAAS) PROVIDER OF CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT SOLUTIONS IN A DIGITAL WORLD, WITH OPERATIONS IN THE US, UK AND INDIA. BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER (B2C) BRANDS QUICKLY OPERATIONALIZE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY ON OUR FEATURE RICH, COMPREHENSIVE, AND OPEN PLATFORM TO OPTIMIZE EXPERIENCE FOR AGENTS, BUSINESSES, AND CUSTOMERS. CONNECTED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI), KNOWLEDGE AND ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES AUTOMATE SELF-SERVICE ACROSS TOUCH POINTS AND AUGMENT A DIGITAL-FIRST, OMNICHANNEL AGENT DESKTOP TO REDUCE SERVICE COST, INCREASE UPSELL, AND IMPROVE BUSINESS AGILITY. HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD, PRIMARILY IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, TELCO, RETAIL, GOVERNMENT, HEALTHCARE AND UTILITIES, RELY ON EGAIN TO PROVIDE A UNIFIED CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT HUB.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, WE COMPLETED OUR TRANSITION FROM A HYBRID MODEL WHERE WE SOLD BOTH SAAS AND PERPETUAL LICENSE SOLUTIONS TO A SAAS ONLY BUSINESS MODEL (SAAS TRANSITION). TODAY WE ONLY SELL SAAS TO NEW CLIENTS AND ARE ACTIVELY MIGRATING OUR REMAINING PERPETUAL LICENSE CLIENTS TO SAAS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GO-FORWARD SAAS BUSINESS MODEL AFFORDS US RECURRING REVENUE VISIBILITY AND MORE PREDICTABILITY. OUR SAAS CLIENTS ADOPT OUR PRODUCT INNOVATION MUCH FASTER THAN IN THE PERPETUAL LICENSE MODEL AND ENJOY BETTER SERVICE LEVELS. FINALLY, WE BELIEVE SAAS CLIENTS ENJOY UP TO 50% FASTER TIME TO VALUE FROM THEIR EGAIN INVESTMENT.  WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (TOPIC 606), AS OF JULY 1, 2018. IN ADDITION, WE ADJUSTED THE PRESENTATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUSINESS MODEL. THROUGH JUNE 30, 2018, OUR REVENUE WAS CLASSIFIED AS RECURRING, LEGACY LICENSE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 AS OF JULY 1, 2018, WE CLASSIFY OUR REVENUE AS SUBSCRIPTION AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE. OUR LEGACY LICENSE REVENUE, WHICH HAS BEEN DECLINING RELATED TO OUR FOCUS ON CLOUD OFFERINGS, IS INCLUDED WITH SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE.  KEY FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE MONITOR THE KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES SET FORTH BELOW AS WELL AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AVAILABLE DEBT CAPACITY, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, TO HELP US EVALUATE TRENDS, ESTABLISH BUDGETS, MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS AND ASSESS OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCIES. THESE KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES INCLUDE CERTAIN NON-GAAP METRICS, INCLUDING NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AS DEFINED BELOW. THE PRESENTATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  WE BELIEVE SAAS REVENUE BETTER REFLECTS OUR BUSINESS MOMENTUM AND TO ANALYZE PROGRESS, WE DISAGGREGATE OUR SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE GROWTH BETWEEN.  \\u00b7  SAAS, WHICH IS DEFINED AS REVENUE FROM CLOUD DELIVERY ARRANGEMENTS, TERM LICENSES AND EMBEDDED OEM ROYALTIES AND ASSOCIATED SUPPORT; AND  \\u00b7  LEGACY SUPPORT, WHICH IS DEFINED AS REVENUE FROM MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS WITH PERPETUAL LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE NO LONGER SELL.  AS WE CONTINUE TO MIGRATE OUR LEGACY PERPETUAL LICENSE CLIENTS TO SAAS, WE EXPECT OUR LEGACY SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE.  TOTAL DEFERRED REVENUE, COLLECTIVELY, INCLUDES BOTH GAAP DEFERRED REVENUE AND NON-GAAP UNBILLED DEFERRED REVENUE THAT REMAINS OFF BALANCE SHEET WHICH REPRESENTS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE.  NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IS DEFINED AS OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  26           MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS USEFUL TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN NON-CASH CHARGES AND NON-CORE OPERATIONAL CHARGES FROM NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BECAUSE (I) THE AMOUNT OF SUCH EXPENSES IN ANY SPECIFIC PERIOD MAY NOT DIRECTLY CORRELATE TO THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS; AND (II) SUCH EXPENSES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN PERIODS AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF NEW STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND ACQUISITIONS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR KEY FINANCIAL MEASURES, INCLUDING A RECONCILIATION OF GAAP INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS TO NON-GAAP INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS FOR EACH OF THE FOLLOWING PERIODS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  DECEMBER 31,  2018  2017  2018  2017  INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS  $2,129  $(396)  $2,882  $(650)  ADD.

THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. ADDITIONALLY, WE HIGHLIGHTED THOSE POLICIES THAT HAVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY AS DISCUSSED IN OUR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THOSE DISCLOSED ON OUR 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 EXCEPT FOR THE ADOPTION OF ASC TOPICS 606 AND SUBTOPIC 340-40 AS DISCUSSED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. WE BELIEVE THESE POLICIES ARE CRITICAL TO THE DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  SOURCES OF REVENUES  OUR REVENUE IS COMPRISED OF TWO CATEGORIES,  SUBSCRIPTION AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. SUBSCRIPTION INCLUDES SAAS REVENUE AND LEGACY SUPPORT REVENUE. SAAS INCLUDES REVENUE FROM CLOUD DELIVERY ARRANGEMENTS, TERM LICENSES AND EMBEDDED OEM ROYALTIES AND ASSOCIATED SUPPORT. LEGACY SUPPORT IS REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH  SUPPORT CONTRACTS ON PERPETUAL LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE NO LONGER SELL. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCLUDES CONSULTING, IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING.  SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE  FOR OUR CLOUD DELIVERY ARRANGEMENTS, OUR MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS AND OUR TERM LICENSE SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT INCORPORATE SUBSTANTIAL CLOUD FUNCTIONALITY,  THE COMBINED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACT TERM AS THE OBLIGATION IS DELIVERED. FOR CONTRACTS INVOLVING DISTINCT SOFTWARE LICENSES, THE LICENSE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER.  27           WE TYPICALLY INVOICE OUR CUSTOMERS IN ADVANCE UPON EXECUTION OF THE CONTRACT OR SUBSEQUENT RENEWALS. INVOICED AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, DEFERRED REVENUE OR REVENUE, DEPENDING IF CONTROL TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON EACH ARRANGEMENT.  THE COMPANY HAS A ROYALTY REVENUE AGREEMENT WITH A CUSTOMER RELATED TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S EMBEDDED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE CUSTOMER IS TO REMIT A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO THE COMPANY. THESE EMBEDDED OEM ROYALTIES ARE INCLUDED AS SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE. UNDER TOPIC 606 REVENUE GUIDANCE, SINCE THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE FOR SALES-BASED LICENSES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, FOR WHICH THE GUIDANCE IN PARAGRAPH ASC 606-10-55-65 APPLIES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE ONLY AS THE SUBSEQUENT SALE OCCURS.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY NOTES THAT SUCH SALES ARE REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER WITH A QUARTER IN ARREARS, SUCH REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME IT IS REPORTED AND PAID BY THE CUSTOMER GIVEN THAT ANY ESTIMATED VARIABLE CONSIDERATION WOULD HAVE TO BE FULLY CONSTRAINED DUE TO THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF SUCH ESTIMATE AND THE UNAVOIDABLE RISK THAT IT MAY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REVENUE REVERSALS.  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE INCLUDES SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION, CONSULTING AND TRAINING. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS BASED ON THEIR STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES.  REVENUE ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS RECOGNIZED AS WORK IS PERFORMED. OUR CONSULTING AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICE CONTRACTS ARE BID EITHER ON A TIME-AND-MATERIALS BASIS OR ON A FIXED-FEE BASIS. FIXED FEES ARE GENERALLY PAID ON MILESTONE BILLING AT PRE-DETERMINED POINTS IN THE CONTRACT.  AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOICED ARE RECORDED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND IN UNEARNED REVENUE OR REVENUE, DEPENDING ON WHETHER TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO CUSTOMERS HAS OCCURRED.  TRAINING REVENUE THAT MEETS THE CRITERIA TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY IS RECOGNIZED WHEN TRAINING IS PROVIDED.  FINANCIAL IMPACT OF TOPIC 606  WE ADOPTED TOPIC 606  ,  AS OF JULY 1, 2018. IN ADDITION, WE ADJUSTED THE PRESENTATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CLOUD DELIVERY MODEL.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT BETWEEN GUIDANCE UNDER TOPIC 605 AND NEWLY ADOPTED GUIDANCE UNDER TOPIC 606 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (IN THOUSANDS).

DEFERRED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE ONCE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE MET. WE GENERALLY INVOICE CUSTOMERS IN ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS. THE DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE OF ANNUAL OR MULTI-YEAR, NON-CANCELABLE CLOUD OR MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT AGREEMENTS. DEFERRED REVENUE IS INFLUENCED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING SEASONALITY, THE COMPOUNDING EFFECTS OF RENEWALS, INVOICE DURATION, INVOICE TIMING AND NEW BUSINESS LINEARITY WITHIN THE QUARTER.  DEFERRED REVENUE THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED DURING THE SUCCEEDING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD IS RECORDED AS CURRENT DEFERRED REVENUE AND THE REMAINING PORTION IS RECORDED AS NONCURRENT.  THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 REQUIRED A CHANGE AS TO HOW WE REPORT DEFERRED REVENUE. UNDER TOPIC 605, AMOUNTS INVOICED BUT NOT COLLECTED WERE NETTED DOWN FROM OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEFERRED REVENUE. WE NO LONGER NET DOWN OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEFERRED REVENUE WITH THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606.  THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 ALSO REQUIRED A CHANGE TO THE DEFINITION OF UNBILLED DEFERRED REVENUE AND REVISIONS TO DISCLOSURES ON OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. UNBILLED DEFERRED REVENUE REPRESENTS BUSINESS THAT IS CONTRACTED BUT NOT YET INVOICED. UNBILLED DEFERRED REVENUE REMAINS OFF THE BALANCE SHEET AND IS NOT RECORDED TO DEFERRED REVENUE. DEFERRED REVENUE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE OF ANNUAL OR MULTI-YEAR, NON-CANCELABLE ARRANGEMENTS.  WE REFER TO THE SUM OF DEFERRED REVENUE AND UNBILLED DEFERRED REVENUE AS TOTAL DEFERRED REVENUE WHICH REPRESENTS A METRIC WE USE IN MONITORING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  WE EXPECT TOTAL DEFERRED REVENUE TO CHANGE QUARTERLY FOR SEVERAL REASONS INCLUDING THE TIMING OF NEW CONTRACTS AND RENEWALS, DURATION AND SIZE OF OUR SUBSCRIPTION AND SUPPORT ARRANGEMENTS, VARIABLE BILLING CYCLES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION. WE TYPICALLY ISSUE RENEWAL INVOICES IN ADVANCE OF THE RENEWAL SERVICE PERIOD. DEPENDING ON TIMING, THE INITIAL INVOICE AND SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL INVOICES MAY OCCUR IN DIFFERENT QUARTERS. THIS MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEFERRED REVENUE.  COSTS CAPITALIZED TO OBTAIN REVENUE CONTRACTS  UNDER TOPIC 606, WE CAPITALIZE INCREMENTAL COSTS TO OBTAIN NON-CANCELABLE SUBSCRIPTION AND MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT REVENUE CONTRACTS WITH AMORTIZATION PERIODS THAT MAY EXTEND LONGER THAN THE NON-CANCELABLE SUBSCRIPTION AND MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT REVENUE CONTRACT TERMS.  WE CAPITALIZE INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A NON-CANCELABLE SUBSCRIPTION AND MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT REVENUE CONTRACT WITH AMORTIZATION PERIODS OF ONE YEAR OR MORE. THE CAPITALIZED AMOUNTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALES COMMISSIONS PAID TO OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE. CAPITALIZED AMOUNTS ALSO INCLUDE (I) AMOUNTS PAID TO EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN THE DIRECT SALES FORCE WHO  29           EARN INCENTIVE PAYOUTS UNDER ANNUAL COMPENSATION PLANS THAT ARE TIED TO THE VALUE OF CONTRACTS ACQUIRED; (II) COMMISSIONS PAID TO EMPLOYEES UPON RENEWALS OF SUBSCRIPTION AND SUPPORT; AND (III) THE ASSOCIATED PAYROLL TAXES AND FRINGE BENEFIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAYMENTS TO OUR EMPLOYEES.  COSTS CAPITALIZED RELATED TO NEW REVENUE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A PERIOD OF BENEFIT THAT WE ESTIMATE TO BE FIVE YEARS. WE DETERMINE THE PERIOD OF BENEFIT BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED DURATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES OF OUR TECHNOLOGY AMONG OTHER FACTORS. AMORTIZATION OF COSTS CAPITALIZED RELATED TO NEW REVENUE CONTRACTS IS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS. UNDER TOPIC 605, WE CAPITALIZED ONLY COMMISSIONS EARNED ON INITIAL SOFTWARE AND SUPPORT SALES WHICH WERE AMORTIZED RATABLY OVER THE INITIAL CONTRACT PERIOD AVERAGING TWO YEARS.

TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY 11% TO $33.4 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $30.0 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2017.  OUR REVENUE WAS IMPACTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR, EURO, AND BRITISH POUND. WE RECALCULATE OUR CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS USING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION RESULTED IN A DECREASE OF $273,000 AND AN INCREASE OF $435,000 IN TOTAL REVENUE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE  30           FLUCTUATION RESULTED IN A DECREASE OF $342,000 AND AN INCREASE OF $468,000 IN TOTAL REVENUE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR REVENUE WAS IMPACTED BY THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.

THE COMPANY RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF VARIOUS ASSETS FROM MODESTO AND BUHL WHICH TOTALED $84,975,000 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  IN APRIL 2017, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE OTHER 50% OF TRUITT BROS., INC. FOR $14,420,000 (NET OF CASH ACQUIRED).  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $103,211,000 IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH INCLUDED BORROWINGS OF $419,102,000 AND THE REPAYMENT OF $517,187,000 OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PRINCIPALLY CONSISTING OF BORROWINGS AND REPAYMENTS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\\u201cREVOLVER\\u201d). THE COMPANY MADE ADDITIONAL REPAYMENTS ON THE REVOLVER FROM CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF MODESTO AND BUHL ASSETS.  OTHER THAN BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER, THERE WAS NO NEW LONG-TERM DEBT DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018 OTHER THAN THE $13,470,000 ACQUIRED VIA THE ACQUISITION OF TRUITT BROS., INC. OF WHICH $3,515,000 WAS PAID OFF IMMEDIATELY. THE COMPANY REPURCHASED $5,340,000 AND $3,442,000 OF STOCK DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (UNAUDITED)  DECEMBER 29, 2018  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ON JULY 5, 2016. AVAILABLE BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVER TOTAL $400,000,000 FROM APRIL THROUGH JULY AND $500,000,000 FROM AUGUST THROUGH MARCH WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JULY 5, 2021.  THE INTEREST RATE ON THE REVOLVER IS BASED ON LIBOR PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN BASED ON EXCESS AVAILABILITY AND THE COMPANY'S FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, THE INTEREST RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.01% ON A BALANCE OF $214,161,000. WE BELIEVE THAT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVER AND OTHER FINANCING SOURCES WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN STANDARD REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EVENTS OF DEFAULT, AND CERTAIN AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS. THE COMPANY IS IN VIOLATION OF A FARM CREDIT TERM LOAN COVENANT REQUIREMENT AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, BUT OBTAINED A WAIVER FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  A MORE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT MUST BE MET AT MARCH 31, 2019, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL FAIL TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT AT THAT DATE, UNLESS AN ADDITIONAL WAIVER OR AMENDMENT IS OBTAINED.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE FARM CREDIT TERM LOAN, AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO AMEND THE FARM CREDIT COVENANTS ON A LONGER TERM BASIS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER.  IN ADDITION, THE REVOLVER AGREEMENT CONTAINS A CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISION.   THE REVOLVER AGREEMENT HAS TRIGGERED AN EVENT OF DEFAULT AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, DUE TO THE FARM CREDIT LOAN DEFAULT.  A WAIVER WAS OBTAINED FROM THE LENDER TO PROVIDE TEMPORARY RELIEF OF DEFAULT AS OF THIS MEASUREMENT DATE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE REVOLVER WILL BE IN DEFAULT AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FARM CREDIT DEFAULT THUS TRIGGERING A CROSS-DEFAULT. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE REVOLVER SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  REFER TO FOOTNOTE 11 OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SEASONALITY  THE COMPANY'S REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY HIGHER IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS. THIS IS DUE IN PART BECAUSE THE COMPANY SELLS, ON A BILL AND HOLD BASIS, GREEN GIANT CANNED AND FROZEN VEGETABLES TO B&G EITHER WEEKLY DURING PRODUCTION FOR SPECIALTY ITEMS, OR AT THE END OF EACH PACK CYCLE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS DURING THESE QUARTERS. B&G BUYS THE PRODUCT FROM THE COMPANY AT COST PLUS A SPECIFIED FEE FOR EACH EQUIVALENT CASE. SEE THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SECTION BELOW FOR FURTHER DETAILS. THE COMPANY\\u2019S NON-GREEN GIANT SALES ALSO EXHIBIT SEASONALITY WITH THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER GENERATING THE HIGHEST RETAIL SALES DUE TO HOLIDAYS THAT OCCUR DURING THAT QUARTER.

INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON SUCH STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY TO EVENTS AS OF THE DATE THE STATEMENTS WERE MADE. AMONG THE FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY ARE.  \\u25cf  GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS;  \\u25cf  COST AND AVAILABILITY OF COMMODITIES AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS VEGETABLES, STEEL AND PACKAGING MATERIALS;  \\u25cf  TRANSPORTATION COSTS;  \\u25cf  CLIMATE AND WEATHER AFFECTING GROWING CONDITIONS AND CROP YIELDS;  \\u25cf  THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING;  \\u25cf  LEVERAGE AND THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO SERVICE AND REDUCE ITS DEBT;  \\u25cf  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS;  \\u25cf  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S MARKETING AND TRADE PROMOTION PROGRAMS;  \\u25cf  CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES;  \\u25cf  COMPETITION;  \\u25cf  PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS;  \\u25cf  THE LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS OR A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN ORDERS FROM THESE CUSTOMERS;  \\u25cf  CHANGES IN, OR THE FAILURE OR INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH, U.S., FOREIGN AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS; AND  \\u25cf  OTHER RISKS DETAILED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE REPORTS FILED BY THE COMPANY WITH THE SEC.  EXCEPT FOR ONGOING OBLIGATIONS TO DISCLOSE MATERIAL INFORMATION AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT UNDERTAKE ANY OBLIGATION TO RELEASE PUBLICLY ANY REVISIONS TO ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS REPORT OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018, THE COMPANY SOLD $65,741,000 OF GREEN GIANT FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY TO B&G FOODS NORTH AMERICA (\\u201cB&G\\u201d) FOR CASH, ON A BILL AND HOLD BASIS, AS COMPARED TO $112,768,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2017. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE BILL AND HOLD AGREEMENT, TITLE TO THE SPECIFIED INVENTORY TRANSFERRED TO B&G. UNDER THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD, THIS CONTRACT QUALIFIES FOR BILL AND HOLD ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AS THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT CONTROL OF THE UNLABELED PRODUCTS TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER AT THE TIME TITLE TRANSFERS AND THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO PAYMENT (PRIOR TO PHYSICAL DELIVERY), WHICH RESULTS IN EARLIER REVENUE RECOGNITION. LABELING AND STORAGE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED AFTER CONTROL OF THE GOODS HAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH REVENUE IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  TRADE PROMOTIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE SALES AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BRANDED PRODUCTS, AND ARE CRITICAL TO THE SUPPORT OF THE BUSINESS. TRADE PROMOTION COSTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF NET SALES, INCLUDE AMOUNTS PAID TO ENCOURAGE RETAILERS TO OFFER TEMPORARY PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS, AMOUNTS PAID TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE DISPLAY POSITIONS IN RETAILERS\\u2019 STORES, AND AMOUNTS PAID TO RETAILERS FOR SHELF SPACE IN RETAIL STORES. ACCRUALS FOR TRADE PROMOTIONS ARE RECORDED PRIMARILY AT THE TIME OF SALE OF PRODUCT TO THE RETAILER BASED ON EXPECTED LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE. SETTLEMENT OF THESE LIABILITIES TYPICALLY OCCURS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS PRIMARILY THROUGH AN AUTHORIZED PROCESS FOR DEDUCTIONS TAKEN BY A RETAILER FROM AMOUNTS OTHERWISE DUE TO US. AS A RESULT, THE ULTIMATE COST OF A TRADE PROMOTION PROGRAM IS DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE SUCCESS OF THE EVENTS AND THE ACTIONS AND LEVEL OF DEDUCTIONS TAKEN BY RETAILERS FOR AMOUNTS THEY CONSIDER DUE TO THEM. FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE PERMISSIBLE DEDUCTIONS MAY TAKE EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (UNAUDITED)  DECEMBER 29, 2018  THE COMPANY USES THE LOWER OF COST, DETERMINED UNDER THE LIFO (LAST-IN, FIRST OUT) METHOD, OR MARKET, TO VALUE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVENTORIES. IN A HIGH INFLATION ENVIRONMENT THAT THE COMPANY WAS EXPERIENCING, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE LIFO METHOD WAS PREFERABLE OVER THE FIFO METHOD BECAUSE IT BETTER COMPARES THE COST OF CURRENT PRODUCTION TO CURRENT REVENUE.  THE COMPANY ASSESSES ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER THERE IS AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ASSIGNED LIVES. THE ASSIGNED LIVES AND THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS USED TO TEST IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECTIVE. IF ACTUAL LIVES ARE SHORTER THAN ANTICIPATED OR IF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN ANTICIPATED, A FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OR A LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF THE ASSETS COULD BE INCURRED. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE EVALUATED IF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. IF SUCH IS THE CASE, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"Seneca Foods Corp\", \"CIK\": 88948, \"Date\": \"2019-02-01T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"SENEA\", \"Name\": \"Seneca Foods Corp\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 2033.0, \"Business\": \"NY\", \"Incorporated\": \"NY\", \"IRS\": 160733425.0, \"key\": \"20190201SENEA\", \"labelr1\": 4.28720808644127, \"labelr2\": -0.4679144385026757, \"labelr3\": 0.0, \"labelr4\": -0.6715916722632734, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5438179, \"prof1\": 0.4561821, \"return1&2\": 0.9616064588641628, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9616064588641628, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.9680645277618404, \"return2\": 1.0046791443850267, \"return1\": 0.9571279191355871, \"return3\": 1.0, \"return4\": 1.0067159167226327, \"1_day_return\": 4.287208086441273, \"cumulative_return1\": 1.478410407068241, \"cumulative_return1&2\": 1.0765577898051422, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": 0.6128270158557668, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.7139048627634919, \"indexx\": 55, \"returnpred\": -4.28720808644127, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9935587138816525, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.9935587138816525, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9886935017971138, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0067762366585589, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0070012480753874}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 64, \"level_0\": 66, \"index\": 13956, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

ARGENTINA  THE COMPANY OPERATES IN ARGENTINA THROUGH CERTAIN WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, \\u201cCLOROX ARGENTINA\\u201d). NET SALES FROM CLOROX ARGENTINA REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 2% AND 3% OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. TOTAL ASSETS OF CLOROX ARGENTINA WERE APPROXIMATELY 1% OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  . THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN ARGENTINA CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE CONTINUING SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN ARGENTINA\\u2019S CURRENCY, HIGH INFLATION AND ECONOMIC RECESSION.  25  EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2018, UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), ARGENTINA WAS DESIGNATED AS A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMY, SINCE IT HAS EXPERIENCED CUMULATIVE INFLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 100 PERCENT OR MORE OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING JULY 1, 2018, THE U.S. DOLLAR REPLACED THE ARGENTINE PESO AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES IN ARGENTINA. CONSEQUENTLY, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR CLOROX ARGENTINA ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS.  VOLATILITY IN THE EXCHANGE RATE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH, ALONG WITH COMPETITION AND CHANGES IN THE RETAIL, LABOR AND MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON CLOROX ARGENTINA\\u2019S NET SALES, NET EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND NET MONETARY ASSET POSITION. THE COMPANY IS CLOSELY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS IN ARGENTINA AND CONTINUES TO TAKE STEPS INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE CONDITIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THESE CONDITIONS AS THEY MAY OCCUR.  CORPORATE  CERTAIN NON-ALLOCATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND VARIOUS OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE REFLECTED IN CORPORATE. CORPORATE ASSETS INCLUDE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, OTHER INVESTMENTS AND DEFERRED TAXES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOWER TAX PAYMENTS, MAINLY DUE TO BENEFITS FROM THE TAX ACT, TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO VENDORS AND TIMING OF COLLECTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY BALANCE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $77 IN THE CURRENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD WAS RELATIVELY FLAT VERSUS $74 IN THE PRIOR SIX-MONTH PERIOD.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $338 IN THE CURRENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD, COMPARED WITH  $177  IN THE PRIOR SIX-MONTH PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASES, A DECREASE IN CASH SOURCED FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND HIGHER DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WILL HAVE THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO MEET ITS FINANCING REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FIXED OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE BASED ON ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, ANTICIPATED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE, INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATINGS, DEMONSTRATED ACCESS TO LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM CREDIT MARKETS AND CURRENT BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ASSESS ITS ABILITY TO FULLY DRAW ON ITS CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND CURRENTLY EXPECTS THAT ANY DRAWING ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE FULLY FUNDED.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY MAINTAINED $38 OF FOREIGN AND OTHER CREDIT LINES, OF WHICH $2 WAS OUTSTANDING.  LONG-TERM BORROWINGS  IN SEPTEMBER 2017, THE COMPANY ISSUED $400 OF SENIOR NOTES WITH AN ANNUAL FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 3.10% AND USED THE PROCEEDS TO REPAY $400 OF SENIOR NOTES WITH AN ANNUAL FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 5.95% THAT BECAME DUE IN OCTOBER 2017.

THESE MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  IN ADDITION, THESE MEASURES MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS SIMILARLY NAMED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE COMPANY USES THE TERM  CONSOLIDATED EBITDA  , WHICH IS A FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP,  BECAUSE IT IS A TERM USED IN ITS CREDIT AGREEMENT. AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, CONSOLIDATED EBITDA REPRESENTS EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO  IS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED EBITDA TO INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES DISCLOSURE OF CONSOLIDATED EBITDA PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT IS USED IN THE PRIMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANT IN THE COMPANY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT.

LOWER RESULTS AT ESPN WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE TAX ACT IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS DETERMINED ON INCOME AFTER ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES, FINANCING COSTS AND INCOME TAXES, AS APPLICABLE.  SEASONALITY  THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF SEASONALITY. CONSEQUENTLY, THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE  QUARTER  ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT, AND FOR THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE, ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE FULL YEAR.  MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS, CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS AND TIMING OF PROGRAM SALES. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE FEES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASC 606, WHICH CHANGED THE TIMING OF AFFILIATE REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN HIGHER REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR.  PARKS, EXPERIENCES & CONSUMER PRODUCTS REVENUES FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL AND LEISURE ACTIVITIES AND SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN INCREASED REVENUES DURING THE COMPANY\\u2019S FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.

IN ADDITION, LICENSING REVENUES FLUCTUATE WITH THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.  STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.  DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER & INTERNATIONAL REVENUES FLUCTUATE BASED ON: THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES OF OUR DIGITAL MEDIA CONTENT; VIEWERSHIP LEVELS ON OUR CABLE CHANNELS AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS; CHANGES IN SUBSCRIBER LEVELS; AND THE DEMAND FOR SPORTS AND DISNEY CONTENT. EACH OF THESE MAY DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CONTENT, WHICH VARIES FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SPORTS SEASONS AND CONTENT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES.  33  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME, WHICH IS SHOWN BELOW ALONG WITH SEGMENT REVENUES.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED $248 MILLION TO $1.0 BILLION DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPENDING ON NEW ATTRACTIONS AT OUR DOMESTIC THEME PARKS AND RESORTS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT MEDIA NETWORKS PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR EXPANDING AND UPGRADING BROADCAST CENTERS, PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND TELEVISION STATION FACILITIES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER & INTERNATIONAL REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT CORPORATE PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS ITS FISCAL  2019  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2018 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $4.5 BILLION DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENTS AT OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS.  OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE 21CF, WHICH, IF COMPLETED, WILL REQUIRE $35.7 BILLION OF CASH AND APPROXIMATELY $35.6 BILLION IN STOCK CONSIDERATION (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.4 BILLION  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, WHICH REFLECTED REPAYMENTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $0.4 BILLION  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS $0.2 BILLION LESS THAN THE  $0.6 BILLION  USED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER AS A DECREASE OF $1.3 BILLION DUE TO NO REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK IN THE CURRENT PERIOD (COMPARED TO $1.3 BILLION PURCHASED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD) WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO A NET INCREASE IN BORROWINGS IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD ($0.3 BILLION DECREASE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO $0.8 BILLION INCREASE IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD).  44  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BORROWING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  QUARTER  ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S BANK FACILITIES. THE COMPANY MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS UNUSED BANK FACILITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.  SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S DIVIDENDS IN FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  . DURING THE  QUARTER  ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO HOLD AS TREASURY SHARES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY\\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND THE CASH CONSIDERATION IN THE PENDING ACQUISITION OF 21CF, ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANY\\u2019S BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , MOODY\\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, STANDARD AND POOR\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A+ AND A-1+, AND FITCH\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND F1, RESPECTIVELY. EACH OF MOODY\\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE, STANDARD AND POOR\\u2019S AND FITCH HAD PLACED THE COMPANY\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS ON REVIEW FOR DOWNGRADE AS A RESULT OF THE PENDING ACQUISITION OF 21CF. ON OCTOBER 8, 2018, MOODY\\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICE AFFIRMED THE COMPANY\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK FOLLOWING ITS REVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION. ON JANUARY 18, 2019, FITCH AFFIRMED THE COMPANY\\u2019S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A AND F1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS STANDARD AND POOR\\u2019S TO FINALIZE ITS REVIEW OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S DEBT RATINGS UPON CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION AND MAY DOWNGRADE OUR LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS. SHOULD A DOWNGRADE OCCUR, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WOULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE COMPANY\\u2019S BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANY\\u2019S BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE ASIA THEME PARKS, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  LEGAL MATTERS  AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS.  GUARANTEES  SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S GUARANTEES.  TAX MATTERS  AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN TAX MATTERS.  CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS  SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS.  OTHER MATTERS  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IN ADDITION, FOR OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  45  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS  WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD\\u2019S REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASES, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.  WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G., THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OR TELEVISION MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE POPULARITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILM\\u2019S RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY\\u2019S ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE LEVEL OF EXPECTED HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VARY BASED ON THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.  WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES ARE PROGRAM RATINGS AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE LICENSING OF PROGRAM RIGHTS WORLDWIDE TO TELEVISION DISTRIBUTORS, SVOD SERVICES AND IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN CANCELLATION OF THE PROGRAM, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AN IMMEDIATE WRITE-DOWN OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES.  WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED SERIES, MOVIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAM\\u2019S RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. WE AMORTIZE RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF EACH YEAR IS BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASON\\u2019S ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF PLANNED USAGE PATTERNS OR ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUES BY YEAR WERE TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, AMORTIZATION OF OUR SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.  COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS, WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANY\\u2019S DAYPARTS ARE: PRIMETIME, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, NEWS AND SPORTS (INCLUDES BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE NETWORK. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. WE HAVE UPDATED OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FEES CHARGED FOR THE RIGHT TO USE OUR TELEVISION AND MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTIONS ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE CONTENT IS AVAILABLE FOR USE BY THE LICENSEE. TV/SVOD DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN MORE THAN ONE TITLE AND/OR PROVIDE THAT CERTAIN TITLES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR USE DURING DEFINED PERIODS OF TIME DURING THE CONTRACT TERM. IN THESE INSTANCES, EACH TITLE AND/OR PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. FOR THESE CONTRACTS, LICENSE FEES ARE ALLOCATED TO EACH TITLE AND PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY AT CONTRACT INCEPTION BASED ON RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE USING MANAGEMENT\\u2019S BEST  46  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  ESTIMATE. ESTIMATES USED TO DETERMINE A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\\u2019 STANDALONE SELLING PRICE IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, BUT NOT THE TOTAL REVENUE TO BE RECOGNIZED UNDER THE ARRANGEMENTS.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS  THE COMPANY\\u2019S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT, WHICH WE EVALUATE ANNUALLY. REFER TO THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ESTIMATED IMPACTS OF CHANGES IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.  THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. THE COMPANY\\u2019S DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AND REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF THE PLANS\\u2019 LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.  TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE.  GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, AND TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT.  TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. WE BELIEVE OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW A MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANT WOULD VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS.  IN TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY\\u2019S LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXCESS. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.  THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY A GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUP\\u2019S LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUP\\u2019S LONG-LIVED ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSET\\u2019S FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE. DETERMINING WHETHER A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS IMPAIRED REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ASSET GROUPS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT ASSET GROUPS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  47  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS THE FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEES AND MARKET VALUES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET OR MARKET VALUES INDICATE AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  WE EVALUATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND ESTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IS TOO LOW, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND IF IT IS TOO HIGH, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION  WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE PROCEEDINGS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES AND HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AS APPROPRIATE. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ALSO BE INVOLVED IN OTHER CONTINGENT MATTERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES FOR A PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSS. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING OTHER CONTINGENT MATTERS. SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.  INCOME TAX AUDITS  AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL, WHERE APPROPRIATE, AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANY\\u2019S SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  MARKET RISK  THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANY\\u2019S EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.  OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  48  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2014 (CONTINUED)  THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, CHINESE YUAN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES. THE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY.  OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.  IT IS THE COMPANY\\u2019S POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.  49\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"WALT DISNEY CO/\", \"CIK\": 1001039, \"Date\": \"2019-02-05T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"DIS\", \"Name\": \"Walt Disney Co\", \"Exchange\": \"NYSE\", \"SIC\": 4841.0, \"Business\": \"CA\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 954545390.0, \"key\": \"20190205DIS\", \"labelr1\": -1.1095331084679567, \"labelr2\": -0.4128893277084586, \"labelr3\": 0.5047318611987403, \"labelr4\": -1.8563357546408457, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5426671999999999, \"prof1\": 0.45733282, \"return1&2\": 1.0152700357996869, \"return1&2&3\": 1.0101456444518018, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.0288973392237075, \"return2\": 1.0041288932770849, \"return1\": 1.0110953310846795, \"return3\": 0.9949526813880126, \"return4\": 1.0185633575464084, \"1_day_return\": -1.1095331084679527, \"cumulative_return1\": 1.5312798549635964, \"cumulative_return1&2\": 1.313837538632712, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": 0.8175422270543371, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.7660281793218008, \"indexx\": 70, \"returnpred\": 1.1095331084679567, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9919824774015961, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.0049887849596517, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9677266727659598, \"cumreturndow\": 1.009266506460771, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0130231240186802}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 84, \"level_0\": 86, \"index\": 20112, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW  GENERAL  CLEARFIELD, INC.  DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES FIBER PROTECTION, FIBER MANAGEMENT AND FIBER DELIVERY SOLUTIONS TO ENABLE RAPID AND  COST-EFFECTIVE FIBER-FED DEPLOYMENT THROUGHOUT THE BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDER SPACE ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. OUR \\u201cFIBER TO ANYWHERE\\u201d  PLATFORM SERVES THE UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS OF LEADING INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (TRADITIONAL CARRIERS), WIRELESS OPERATORS,  MSO/CABLE TV COMPANIES, AND COMPETITIVE LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIERS (ALTERNATIVE CARRIERS), WHILE ALSO CATERING TO THE BROADBAND NEEDS  OF THE UTILITY/MUNICIPALITY, ENTERPRISE, DATA CENTER, AND MILITARY MARKETS.  THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES  BUILD-TO-PRINT SERVICES FOR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEM) REQUIRING COPPER AND FIBER CABLE ASSEMBLIES BUILT TO THEIR SPECIFICATIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY FOCUSED ON THE  UN-SERVED OR UNDER-SERVED RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT RECEIVE THEIR VOICE, VIDEO AND DATA SERVICES FROM INDEPENDENT TELEPHONE COMPANIES.  BY ALIGNING ITS IN-HOUSE ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE ALONGSIDE ITS CUSTOMERS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP, CUSTOMIZE  AND ENHANCE PRODUCTS FROM DESIGN THROUGH PRODUCTION. FINAL BUILD AND ASSEMBLY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PRODUCTS IS COMPLETED AT CLEARFIELD\\u2019S  PLANTS IN BROOKLYN PARK, MINNESOTA, AND MEXICO, WITH MANUFACTURING SUPPORT FROM A NETWORK OF DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL MANUFACTURING  PARTNERS. CLEARFIELD SPECIALIZES IN PRODUCING THESE PRODUCTS ON BOTH A QUICK-TURN AND SCHEDULED DELIVERY BASIS. THE COMPANY DEPLOYS  A HYBRID SALES MODEL WITH SOME SALES MADE DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER, SOME MADE THROUGH TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION (CHANNEL) PARTNERS,  AND SOME SALES THROUGH ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS WHO PRIVATE LABEL THEIR PRODUCTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 VS. THREE  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WERE $20,089,000, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 19% OR $3,222,000, FROM NET SALES OF $16,867,000 FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. NET SALES TO BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE $18,800,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 VERSUS  $16,020,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018. AMONG THIS GROUP, THE COMPANY RECORDED $1,585,000 IN INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 VERSUS $1,369,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018. NET SALES TO BUILD-TO-PRINT CUSTOMERS WERE $1,289,000  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 VERSUS $847,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018. THE COMPANY ALLOCATES SALES FROM EXTERNAL  CUSTOMERS TO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS BASED ON THE LOCATION TO WHICH THE PRODUCT IS TRANSPORTED. ACCORDINGLY, INTERNATIONAL SALES REPRESENTED  8% OF TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF BOTH FISCAL 2019 AND 2018.  11  THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 OF $3,222,000 COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES  TO AN OEM MANUFACTURER IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,732,000 DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF OUR ACTIVE CABINET LINE IN FEBRUARY 2018. ADDITIONALLY,  SALES TO BUILD-TO-PRINT CUSTOMERS INCREASED $442,000 DURING THE SAME PERIOD DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEMAND. REVENUE FROM ALL CUSTOMERS  IS OBTAINED FROM PURCHASE ORDERS SUBMITTED FROM TIME TO TIME. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO PREDICT ORDERS IN FUTURE  PERIODS OR TRENDS AFFECTING ORDERS IN FUTURE PERIODS IS LIMITED.  COST OF SALES FOR  THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS $12,142,000, AN INCREASE OF $2,384,000, OR 24%, FROM $9,758,000 IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  FISCAL 2018. GROSS PROFIT PERCENT WAS 39.6% IN THE FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER, DOWN FROM 42.1% FOR THE FISCAL 2018 FIRST QUARTER.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $839,000, OR 12%, TO $7,947,000 FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $7,108,000 IN THE COMPARABLE  PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.  THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME WHILE  THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ACQUIRED ACTIVE CABINET LINE INTO  ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AS WELL AS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PRODUCTS, WHICH HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED $312,000, OR 5%, TO $6,776,000 IN THE FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER FROM $6,464,000 FOR THE FISCAL 2018 FIRST QUARTER. THE  INCREASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF AN INCREASE  OF $627,000 IN COMPENSATION COSTS DUE PRIMARILY TO ADDITIONAL SALES AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL AND AN INCREASE OF $120,000 OF DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. THESE WERE SOMEWHAT OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $624,000 IN LEGAL EXPENSES, MAINLY DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT  OF A PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT THAT OCCURRED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $1,171,000 COMPARED TO INCOME FROM OPERATIONS OF $644,000 FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, AN INCREASE  OF APPROXIMATELY 82%. THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED GROSS PROFIT, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SELLING, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  INTEREST INCOME FOR  THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $135,000 COMPARED TO $96,000 FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER FOR FISCAL 2018. THE INCREASE IS  DUE MAINLY TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES EARNED ON ITS INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2019. THE COMPANY INVESTS ITS EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN  FDIC-BACKED BANK CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS.  WE RECORDED A PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES OF $296,000 AND A BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES OF $203,000 FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  WE RECORD OUR QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR. THE INCREASE  IN TAX EXPENSE OF $499,000 FROM THE FIRST QUARTER FOR FISCAL 2018 IS PRIMARILY DUE  TO THE TAX REFORM ACT ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22,  2017 THAT RESULTED IN A LOWER FEDERAL TAX RATE AND A ONE-TIME BENEFIT OF $384,000 RELATED TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A REVALUATION  OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY THAT DECREASED THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  THE INCREASE IN THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATE TO 22.7% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FROM NEGATIVE 27.4% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2018 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ONE-TIME BENEFIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 FROM THE TAX REFORM ACT AS DESCRIBED.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S NET INCOME  FOR  THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $1,010,000, OR $0.08 PER BASIC AND DILUTED SHARE.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S NET INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WAS $943,000, OR $0.07 PER BASIC AND DILUTED SHARE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE  OF LIQUIDITY WAS OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THOSE SOURCES TOTAL $23,849,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED  TO $17,478,000 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. OUR EXCESS CASH IS INVESTED MAINLY IN CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT BACKED BY THE FDIC AND MONEY  MARKET ACCOUNTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FUNDS ARE INSURED BY THE FDIC. INVESTMENTS CONSIDERED LONG-TERM WERE $18,292,000 AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018, COMPARED TO $17,974,000 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. WE BELIEVE THE COMBINED BALANCES OF SHORT-TERM CASH AND INVESTMENTS  ALONG WITH LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE INDICATION OF OUR AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY. WE HAD NO LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS  AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 OR SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  12  WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH EQUIVALENTS AND  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, ALONG WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS  FOR BEYOND THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  THE COMPANY INTENDS ON UTILIZING ITS AVAILABLE  CASH AND ASSETS PRIMARILY FOR ITS CONTINUED ORGANIC GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FUTURE STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS EXECUTION OF  THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ADOPTED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED ON NOVEMBER  13, 2014 WITH $8,000,000 AUTHORIZED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. ON APRIL 25, 2017, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE AUTHORIZATION  TO $12,000,000 OF COMMON STOCK.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED  $6,826,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $1,010,000, NON-CASH EXPENSES  FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF $529,000, AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OF $539,000 IN ADDITION TO CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES PROVIDING CASH. CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PROVIDING CASH INCLUDE DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  AND INVENTORIES OF $4,654,000 AND $424,000, RESPECTIVELY. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES CAN BE INFLUENCED BY THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS  FOR CUSTOMER PROJECTS AND PAYMENT TERMS. DAY\\u2019S SALES OUTSTANDING, WHICH MEASURES HOW QUICKLY RECEIVABLES ARE COLLECTED, DECREASED  15 DAYS TO 37 DAYS FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY REPRESENTS AN ADJUSTMENT FOR SEASONAL  DEMAND ALONG WITH CHANGES IN STOCKING LEVELS. CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS USING CASH INCLUDE A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,  ACCRUED EXPENSES AND DEFERRED RENT OF $432,000 WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTS FISCAL 2018 ACCRUED BONUS COMPENSATION ACCRUALS PAID IN  THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED  $2,005,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $943,000, NON-CASH EXPENSES FOR  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF $436,000, AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OF $483,000, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY A NON-CASH BENEFIT TO DEFERRED  TAXES OF $384,000 RELATED TO THE NEWLY ENACTED TAX REFORM ACT, IN ADDITION TO CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PROVIDING  CASH. CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PROVIDING CASH INCLUDE DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES OF $1,667,000  AND $313,000, RESPECTIVELY. DAY\\u2019S SALES OUTSTANDING DECREASED SIX DAYS TO 30 DAYS FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 TO DECEMBER 31,  2017. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY REPRESENTS AN ADJUSTMENT FOR SEASONAL DEMAND ALONG WITH CHANGES IN STOCKING LEVELS. CHANGES IN  WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS USING CASH INCLUDE A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND DEFERRED RENT OF $1,498,000 WHICH  PRIMARILY REFLECTS FISCAL 2017 ACCRUED BONUS COMPENSATION ACCRUALS PAID IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  WE INVEST OUR EXCESS CASH IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS  AND BANK CDS IN DENOMINATIONS ACROSS NUMEROUS BANKS. WE BELIEVE WE OBTAIN A COMPETITIVE RATE OF RETURN GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE  ALONG WITH THE SECURITY PROVIDED BY THE FDIC ON THESE INVESTMENTS. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE USED CASH  TO PURCHASE $1,558,000 OF FDIC-BACKED SECURITIES AND RECEIVED $1,680,000 ON CDS THAT MATURED. PURCHASES OF PATENTS AND CAPITAL  EQUIPMENT, MAINLY RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT, CONSUMED $277,000 OF CASH.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017,  WE USED CASH TO PURCHASE $2,466,000 OF FDIC-BACKED SECURITIES AND RECEIVED $2,477,000 ON CDS THAT MATURED. PURCHASES OF PATENTS  AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, MAINLY RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT, CONSUMED $230,000 OF CASH.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018,  WE RECEIVED $146,000 FROM EMPLOYEES\\u2019 PARTICIPATION AND PURCHASE OF STOCK THROUGH OUR ESPP AND USED $7,000 TO PAY FOR TAXES  AS A RESULT OF EMPLOYEES\\u2019 VESTING OF RESTRICTED SHARES USING SHARE WITHHOLDING.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE RECEIVED $148,000 FROM EMPLOYEES\\u2019 PARTICIPATION AND PURCHASE OF STOCK THROUGH OUR ESPP AND USED  $9,000 TO PAY FOR TAXES AS A RESULT OF EMPLOYEES\\u2019 EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS AND VESTING OF RESTRICTED SHARES USING SHARE  WITHHOLDING. ADDITIONALLY, WE USED $11,000 TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  AS  OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAD AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY $7,159,000 IN ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED  ON NOVEMBER 13, 2014 THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASED ON APRIL 25, 2017.  13  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT UTILIZES ITS TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE,  CUMULATIVE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE, JUDGMENT AND OTHER FACTORS IN THE SELECTION AND APPLICATION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE  THEY REQUIRE THE MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, STOCK BASED COMPENSATION, DEFERRED  TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES, ACCRUALS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN ITEM  7. \\u201cMANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\u201d OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THERETO AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q.  ALL REFERENCES HEREIN TO THE TERM \\u201cFISCAL YEAR\\u201d SHALL MEAN A YEAR ENDED MARCH 31 OF THE YEAR SPECIFIED.  WESTELL TECHNOLOGIES, INC., (THE COMPANY) IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION AND DIFFERENTIATION AT THE EDGE OF COMMUNICATION NETWORKS WHERE END USERS CONNECT.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS ENABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND NETWORK OPERATORS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE OPERATING EXPENSES.  WITH MILLIONS OF PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED WORLDWIDE, WESTELL IS A TRUSTED PARTNER FOR TRANSFORMING NETWORKS INTO HIGH-QUALITY, RELIABLE SYSTEMS.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S  THREE  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  IN-BUILDING WIRELESS (IBW) SEGMENT  IBW SEGMENT SOLUTIONS ENABLE CELLULAR COVERAGE IN STADIUMS, ARENAS, MALLS, BUILDINGS, AND OTHER INDOOR AREAS NOT SERVED WELL OR AT ALL BY THE EXISTING \\\"MACRO\\\" OUTDOOR CELLULAR NETWORK.  FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICE, SOLUTIONS INCLUDE DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEMS (DAS) CONDITIONERS AND DIGITAL REPEATERS.  FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY MARKET, SOLUTIONS INCLUDE HALF-WATT AND TWO-WATT REPEATERS AND A BATTERY BACKUP UNIT.  IBW ALSO OFFERS ANCILLARY PRODUCTS THAT CONSIST OF PASSIVE SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND ANTENNAS FOR BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC SAFETY MARKETS.  INTELLIGENT SITE MANAGEMENT (ISM) SEGMENT (FORMERLY INTELLIGENT SITE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES OR ISMS)  ISM SEGMENT SOLUTIONS INCLUDE A SUITE OF REMOTE UNITS, WHICH ARE NETWORK DEVICES USED FOR ON-SITE PROCESSING.  REMOTES PROVIDE ON-SITE MACHINE-TO-MACHINE (M2M) COMMUNICATIONS THAT ENABLE OPERATORS TO REMOTELY MONITOR, MANAGE, AND CONTROL SITE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS.  REMOTES CAN BE AND OFTEN ARE COMBINED WITH OUR OPTIMA MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SYSTEM.  ISM ALSO OFFERS SUPPORT SERVICES (I.E., MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS) AND DEPLOYMENT SERVICES (I.E., INSTALLATION).  COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK SOLUTIONS (CNS) SEGMENT  CNS SEGMENT SOLUTIONS INCLUDE A BROAD RANGE OF OUTDOOR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE OFFERINGS CONSISTING OF INTEGRATED CABINETS, POWER DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTS, COPPER AND FIBER CONNECTIVITY PANELS, FIBER ACCESS PRODUCTS, T1 NETWORK INTERFACE UNITS (NIUS), AND TOWER MOUNTED AMPLIFIERS (TMAS).  CUSTOMERS  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CUSTOMER BASE INCLUDES COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS, NEUTRAL-HOST OPERATORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS.  DUE TO THE STRINGENT CUSTOMER QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS AND REGULATED ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH MANY CUSTOMERS  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATE, THE COMPANY MUST UNDERGO LENGTHY APPROVAL AND PROCUREMENT PROCESSES PRIOR TO SELLING MOST OF ITS PRODUCTS.  ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT UP-FRONT INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCT AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO ACTUAL COMMENCEMENT OF SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS.  THE PRICES FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VARY BASED UPON VOLUME, CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS, AND OTHER CRITERIA, AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING COST AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS.  TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND/OR IN TARGETED SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS TO LAUNCH NEW PRODUCT LINES AND FEATURES.  FAILURE TO INCREASE REVENUES FROM NEW PRODUCTS, WHETHER DUE TO LACK OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, COMPETITION, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, PURCHASING DECISIONS, MEETING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS, OR OTHERWISE, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES AND INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  IN VIEW OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S RELIANCE ON THE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET FOR REVENUES, THE PROJECT NATURE OF THE BUSINESS, THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF ORDERS, AND PRICING PRESSURES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN INDICATION OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN CUSTOMER ORDERING AND PURCHASING ACTIVITY DUE PRIMARILY TO THE PROJECT-BASED NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND DUE TO BUDGETING AND PROCUREMENT PATTERNS TOWARD THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR OR THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CALENDAR YEAR.  WHILE THESE FACTORS CAN RESULT IN THE GREATEST FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S THIRD AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS, THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT AND MAY NOT ALWAYS CORRELATE TO FINANCIAL RESULTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  BELOW IS A TABLE THAT COMPARES REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  , AND  2017  , BY SEGMENT.  REVENUE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  CHANGE  2018  2017  CHANGE  IBW  $2,794  $5,223  $(2,429  )  $9,997  $20,098  $(10,101  )  ISM  5,116  5,802  (686  )  13,506  14,662  (1,156  )  CNS  2,812  2,650  162  10,362  12,721  (2,359  )  CONSOLIDATED REVENUE  $10,722  $13,675  $(2,953  )  $33,865  $47,481  $(13,616  )  IBW REVENUE WAS  $2.8 MILLION  AND  $10.0 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $5.2 MILLION  AND  $20.1 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR BOTH PERIODS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES OF DAS CONDITIONERS, COMMERCIAL REPEATERS, AND ANCILLARY PRODUCTS.  SALES OF DAS CONDITIONERS HAVE DECREASED DUE TO A NETWORK ARCHITECTURE SHIFT TO AN ALTERNATIVE, NON-DAS SOLUTION FOR IN-BUILDING COVERAGE IN LARGE VENUES SUCH AS STADIUMS AND ARENAS.  GOING FORWARD, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE SALES OF DAS CONDITIONERS TO REBOUND TO PREVIOUS LEVELS, BUT WE DO EXPECT ON-GOING DEMAND WHERE CUSTOMERS MAY ADD CAPACITY TO THE EXISTING EMBEDDED BASE OF LARGE-VENUE DAS NETWORKS, AS WELL AS IN SMALLER IN-BUILDING DAS DEPLOYMENTS THAT REQUIRE A STAND-ALONE CONDITIONER.  WHILE WE EXPECT THE COMMERCIAL REPEATER MARKET TO EITHER REMAIN FLAT OR DECLINE FURTHER, AS CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO SHIFT TO OTHER FORMS OF COMMERCIAL IN-BUILDING COVERAGE SUCH AS SMALL CELLS, WE EXPECT THE MARKET FOR PUBLIC SAFETY REPEATERS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS MORE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES PASS AND ENFORCE ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE IN-BUILDING CELLULAR COMMUNICATION COVERAGE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.  ISM REVENUE WAS  $5.1 MILLION  AND  $13.5 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $5.8 MILLION  AND  $14.7 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR BOTH PERIODS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN SERVICES REVENUE, WHICH WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN BOTH DEPLOYMENT AND SUPPORT SERVICE REVENUE FROM ONE MAJOR DOMESTIC CUSTOMER.  THE SERVICES REVENUE DECLINE WAS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRODUCT REVENUE.  DUE TO THE PROJECT-BASED NATURE OF OUR ISM BUSINESS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON FUTURE TRENDS.  CNS REVENUE WAS  $2.8 MILLION  AND  $10.4 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $2.7 MILLION  AND  $12.7 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES OF INTEGRATED CABINETS AND COPPER/FIBER NETWORK CONNECTIVITY PANELS AS WELL AS REVENUE FROM OUR FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS INTRODUCED EARLIER THIS YEAR, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF POWER DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTS, T1 NIUS, AND TMAS.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER SALES OF INTEGRATED CABINETS, T1 NIUS, AND TMAS, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES OF COPPER/FIBER NETWORK CONNECTIVITY PANELS AND OUR NEW FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS.  WE EXPECT REVENUE FROM OUR NEW FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS TO GROW.  WE EXPECT SALES OF INTEGRATED CABINETS, WHICH ARE HEAVILY PROJECT-BASED, TO REMAIN UNEVEN, WHILE SALES OF POWER DISTRIBUTION PRODUCTS AND COPPER/FIBER CONNECTIVITY PANELS ARE EXPECTED TO AT LEAST REMAIN STEADY.  WE EXPECT T1 NIUS AND TMA REVENUE TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE OVER TIME AS THESE PRODUCTS ARE IN DECLINING MARKETS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS MARGIN  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  2017  CHANGE  2018  2017  CHANGE  IBW  38.3%  47.3%  (9.0  )%  44.2%  45.4%  (1.2  )%  ISM  56.7%  54.5%  2.2%  53.8%  51.2%  2.6%  CNS  22.1%  16.9%  5.2%  29.2%  27.4%  1.8%  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN  42.8%  44.4%  (1.6  )%  43.5%  42.4%  1.1%  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN CHANGES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD ARE A FUNCTION OF THE REVENUE MIX AMONG THE THREE SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS MARGIN CHANGES WITHIN EACH OF THE SEGMENTS WHICH ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER MIX, REVENUE LEVELS, PRICES, AND COSTS.  THE SLIGHT YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LOWER MARGIN WITH THE IBW SEGMENT DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER IBW SEGMENT REVENUE, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE HIGHER MARGIN ISM SEGMENT REPRESENTING A GREAT PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL REVENUE MIX.  THE SLIGHT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER MARGIN ISM SEGMENT REPRESENTING A GREAT PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL REVENUE MIX.

THE INCREASE IN THE COMPARABLE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE SPENDING IN THE NEW FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS IN THE CNS SEGMENT. THE DECREASE IN THE COMPARABLE NINE MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IBW SEGMENT, WHERE THE BUSINESS SHIFTED ITS FOCUS TO PURSUE GROWTH VIA OEM PARTNERSHIPS RATHER THAN DEVELOPING PRODUCTS INTERNALLY.  THIS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A CNS INCREASE RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEW FIBER ACCESS SOLUTIONS.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE DECREASED  $0.3 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER EXPENSE STRUCTURE AS A PART OF THE COMPANY'S AFOREMENTIONED OVERALL RESETTING OF COST AND EXPENSE.

THE INCREASE IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EXTERNAL PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN THE NINE MONTH PERIOD WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOWER EXPENSE STRUCTURE AS A PART OF THE COMPANY'S AFOREMENTIONED OVERALL RESETTING OF COST AND EXPENSE.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  CHANGE  2018  2017  CHANGE  CONSOLIDATED INTANGIBLE  AMORTIZATION  $830  $1,047  $(217  )  $2,652  $3,142  $(490  )  AMORTIZATION IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND DECEMBER 31, 2017 WERE NON-CASH EXPENSES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ESTABLISHED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS WITHIN ALL THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS DURING THE 2012 TO 2014 TIME FRAMES.  THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, TRADE NAMES, AND BACKLOG DERIVED FROM THE ACQUISITIONS.  THE DECREASE IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER RELATED INTANGIBLES FROM THE ANTONE ACQUISITION BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED.

DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-RECURRING FOREIGN CURRENCY GAIN OF $0.6 MILLION RELATED TO THE WIND-DOWN OF THE NORANTEL LEGAL ENTITY.  THE DECREASE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET DUE TO INCREASED INTEREST RATES ON INVESTMENTS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \\u201cACT\\u201d).  THE ACT SIGNIFICANTLY REVISES THE FUTURE ONGOING U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING THE U.S. CORPORATE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM  34%  TO  21%  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  THE FINAL TRANSITION IMPACTS OF THE ACT MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATES, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN INTERPRETATIONS OF THE ACT, ANY LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS THAT ARISE BECAUSE OF THE ACT, ANY CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR INCOME TAXES OR RELATED INTERPRETATIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE ACT, OR ANY UPDATES OR CHANGES TO ESTIMATES THE COMPANY HAS UTILIZED TO CALCULATE THE TRANSITION IMPACTS, INCLUDING IMPACTS FROM CHANGES TO CURRENT YEAR EARNINGS ESTIMATES.  THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ALLOWS FOR A MEASUREMENT PERIOD OF UP TO ONE YEAR AFTER THE ENACTMENT DATE OF THE ACT TO FINALIZE THE RECORDING OF THE RELATED TAX IMPACTS.  IN THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY HAS FINALIZED ITS ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT WITH NO MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY HAS  $697,000  OF FEDERAL ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX (\\\"AMT\\\")  CREDIT CARRYFORWARD.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMOUNT BY  2022  VIA A TAX REFUND.  THE COMPANY RECORDED  $1,000  AND  $11,000  OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, USING AN EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF  (0.32)%  PLUS DISCRETE ITEMS.  THE COMPANY RECORDED  $685,000  AND  $660,000  OF INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  , USING AN EFFECTIVE RATE OF  1.76%  PLUS DISCRETE ITEMS.  THE EFFECTIVE RATE IN BOTH PERIODS IS IMPACTED BY THE INTRAPERIOD ALLOCATION AS A RESULT OF INCOME OR LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, AND STATES WHICH BASE TAX ON GROSS MARGIN AND NOT PRETAX INCOME.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN EXPENSE OF  $0.1 MILLION  FOR LOSS CONTINGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH TWO INDEMNITY CLAIMS RELATED TO A SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER CONTRACT.  BOTH OF THESE CLAIMS RELATE TO A BUSINESS WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY SOLD AND THEREFORE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE RANGE OF THE COMBINED PROBABLE LOSSES TO BE $0.1 MILLION TO $0.5 MILLION.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET INCOME (LOSS)  NET LOSS WAS  $1.6 MILLION  AND  $3.3 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  NET INCOME WAS  $0.8 MILLION  AND  $0.9 MILLION  IN THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  .  THE CHANGES WERE A RESULT OF THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THE VARIANCES IDENTIFIED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD  $27.1 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTING OF BANK DEPOSITS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL SATISFY CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CASH FLOWS  THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $638  $5,069  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  2,506  (4,798  )  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1,038  )  (558  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE ON CHANGES ON CASH  (4  )  1  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $2,102  $(286  )  NET CASH  PROVIDED  BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.6 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $5.1 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE CHANGE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE NET LOSS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS AND AN INCREASE IN CASH USED BY WORKING CAPITAL WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET CASH  PROVIDED  BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $2.5 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $4.8 MILLION  USED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONVERSION OF ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS INTO CASH EQUIVALENTS.  NET CASH  USED  BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.0 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $0.6 MILLION  USED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASED USE OF CASH WAS DUE PRIMARILY FROM THE INCREASED PURCHASES OF TREASURY STOCK.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY  $37.0 MILLION  BEFORE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF  $37.0 MILLION  .  ALSO, AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD A $3.0 MILLION TAX CONTINGENCY RESERVE RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, WHICH IS OFFSET AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  THE FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARD BEGINS TO EXPIRE IN FISCAL YEAR 2023.  REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\\u2019S FUTURE DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS IS DEPENDENT UPON GENERATING SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME PRIOR TO THEIR EXPIRATION, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  THE COMPANY WEIGHED POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND WHETHER A TAX BENEFIT SHOULD BE RECORDED WHEN TAXABLE LOSSES ARE INCURRED.  THE EXISTENCE OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE DOES NOT LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF TAX ASSETS TO REDUCE TAXES PAYABLE WHEN TAXABLE INCOME ARISES.  MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND MAY ADJUST THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ACCORDINGLY.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS A  50%  EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN ACCESSTEL KENTROX AUSTRALIA PTY LTD (AKA).  AKA DISTRIBUTES NETWORK MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER  50%  OWNER TO ONE CUSTOMER.  THE COMPANY HOLDS EQUAL VOTING CONTROL WITH THE OTHER OWNER.  ALL ACTIONS OF AKA ARE DECIDED AT THE BOARD LEVEL BY MAJORITY VOTE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS PROVIDED AN UNLIMITED GUARANTEE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OTHER 50% OWNER IN AKA, WHICH PRIMARILY PROVIDES SUPPORT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER.  THIS GUARANTEE WAS PUT IN PLACE AT THE REQUEST OF THE AKA CUSTOMER.  THE GUARANTEE,  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE A MAXIMUM POTENTIAL FUTURE PAYMENT OF  $0.7 MILLION  , WILL STAY IN PLACE AS LONG AS THE CONTRACT BETWEEN AKA AND THE CUSTOMER IS IN PLACE.  THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE RECOURSE AGAINST THE OTHER 50% OWNER IN AKA IN THE EVENT THE GUARANTEE IS TRIGGERED.  THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT COULD PERFORM ON THE OBLIGATION IT GUARANTEED AT A POSITIVE RATE OF RETURN AND, THEREFORE, DID NOT ASSIGN VALUE TO THE GUARANTEE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS DISCUSSED IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUE  THE COMPANY RECORDS REVENUE BASED ON A FIVE-STEP MODEL IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606.  THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES IDENTIFIED IN CONTRACTS.  A CONTRACT EXISTS WHEN BOTH PARTIES HAVE AN APPROVED AGREEMENT THAT CREATES ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, IDENTIFIES PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND PAYMENT TERMS AND HAS COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE.  THE COMPANY RECORDS REVENUE FROM THESE CONTRACTS WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TRANSFER TO THE CUSTOMER.  THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IS BASED UPON THE CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF ANY VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S REVENUE IS RECORDED AT A POINT IN TIME FROM THE SALE OF TANGIBLE PRODUCTS.  REVENUE IS RECORDED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, DEPENDENT UPON THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACT.  FOR RIGHT-TO-USE SOFTWARE, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME THE CUSTOMER HAS THE RIGHT TO USE AND CAN SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFIT FROM USE OF THE SOFTWARE.  PRODUCTS REGULARLY INCLUDE WARRANTIES THAT INCLUDE BUG FIXES, AND MINOR UPDATES SO THAT THE PRODUCT CONTINUES TO FUNCTION AS PROMISED IN A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT, AND PHONE SUPPORT.  THESE STANDARD WARRANTIES ARE ASSURANCE TYPE WARRANTIES WHICH DO NOT OFFER ANY SERVICES BEYOND THE ASSURANCE THAT THE PRODUCT WILL CONTINUE WORKING AS SPECIFIED.  THEREFORE, WARRANTIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  INSTEAD, THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE EXPECTED COST OF WARRANTY.  EXTENDED WARRANTIES ARE SOLD SEPARATELY WITH A POST CONTRACT SUPPORT (PCS) AGREEMENT.  PCS REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME DURING THE SUPPORT PERIOD.  REVENUE FROM INSTALLATION SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED OR TRANSFERRED AS THIS IS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS OBTAINED CONTROL.  THE COMPANY HAS CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  WHEN THE SALES AGREEMENT INVOLVES MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, EACH OBLIGATION IS SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED AND THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING THE PROMISED GOOD OR SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  IN MOST CASES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES THE CONSIDERATION TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE (RSP) OF THE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE RSP IS NOT OBSERVABLE, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS BY UTILIZING THE RESIDUAL APPROACH.  FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT THE COMPANY SATISFIES OVER TIME, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BY CONSISTENTLY APPLYING A METHOD OF MEASURING PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETE SATISFACTION OF THAT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE METHOD THAT MOST ACCURATELY DEPICTS THE PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  IF THE MEASURE OF REMAINING RIGHTS EXCEEDS THE MEASURE OF THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A CONTRACT ASSET.  CONVERSELY, IF THE MEASURE OF THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDS THE MEASURE OF THE REMAINING RIGHTS, THE COMPANY RECORDS A CONTRACT LIABILITY.  CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO PRODUCT RETURNS WILL BE RECORDED AS CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND PRESENTED ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND DEFERRED REVENUE, RESPECTIVELY.  CUSTOMER BILLINGS FOR SERVICES NOT YET RENDERED ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AS THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED.  THE ASSOCIATED DEFERRED REVENUE IS INCLUDED IN DEFERRED REVENUE OR DEFERRED REVENUE NON-CURRENT, AS APPROPRIATE, IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"WESTELL TECHNOLOGIES INC\", \"CIK\": 1002135, \"Date\": \"2019-02-08T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"WSTL\", \"Name\": \"Westell Technologies Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 3661.0, \"Business\": \"IL\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 363154957.0, \"key\": \"20190208WSTL\", \"labelr1\": 0.4694835680751282, \"labelr2\": -1.4018691588785164, \"labelr3\": 1.8957345971563997, \"labelr4\": -2.3255813953488293, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.62707675, \"prof1\": 0.37292328, \"return1&2\": 1.0092580404545657, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9901251866070856, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.0131513537374828, \"return2\": 1.0140186915887852, \"return1\": 0.9953051643192488, \"return3\": 0.9810426540284359, \"return4\": 1.0232558139534882, \"1_day_return\": 0.4694835680751242, \"cumulative_return1\": 1.6006309864754622, \"cumulative_return1&2\": 1.2172929722409735, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": 0.6882500167364497, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.5643093674881092, \"indexx\": 115, \"returnpred\": -0.4694835680751282, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9962829083158127, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.004768574220121, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9057455674831345, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0012081964600288, \"cumreturnsp500\": 0.9995698493038732}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 122, \"level_0\": 124, \"index\": 39666, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

BROMPHENIRAMINE/PSEUDOEPHEDRINE  IMMEDIATE RELEASE CAPSULES  ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2011,  THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH ECR PHARMACEUTICALS (\\u201cECR\\u201d), LAUNCHED BROM/PSEUD CAPSULES UNDER THE BRAND NAME, LODRANE D\\u00ae,  AN IMMEDIATE RELEASE FORMULATION OF BROMPHENIRAMINE MALEATE AND PSEUDOEPHEDRINE HCL, AN EFFECTIVE, LOW-SEDATING ANTIHISTAMINE  COMBINED WITH A DECONGESTANT.  BROM/PSEUD CAPSULES  ARE MARKETED UNDER THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MONOGRAPH (THE \\u201cOTC MONOGRAPH\\u201d) AND ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE CODE OF FEDERAL  REGULATIONS CAN BE LAWFULLY MARKETED IN THE US WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE FDA. WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE FDA HAS REVISED  ITS ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THESE UNAPPROVED PRODUCTS MAY BE MARKETED. IF THE  FDA DETERMINES THAT A COMPANY IS DISTRIBUTING AN UNAPPROVED PRODUCT THAT REQUIRES APPROVAL, THE FDA MAY TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION  IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PRODUCT SEIZURES AND SEEKING A JUDICIAL INJUNCTION AGAINST DISTRIBUTION.  ELITE MANUFACTURES  THIS PRODUCT, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MERGERS AND SUCCESSOR ENTITIES EFFECTING THE MARKETING OF THIS PRODUCT AND TRANSFER  OF BRAND NAME OWNERSHIP SINCE THIS PRODUCT WAS ORIGINALLY LAUNCHED. MARKETING OF THIS PRODUCT UNDER THE LODRANE D\\u00ae WAS LAST  CONDUCTED BY VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS INTERNATIONAL INC.

SEQUESTOXTM IS AN IMMEDIATE-RELEASE OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE CONTAINING SEQUESTERED NALTREXONE WHICH INCORPORATES 5MG, 10MG,  15MG, 20MG AND 30MG DOSES OF OXYCODONE INTO CAPSULES.  IN JANUARY 2016, THE  COMPANY SUBMITTED A 505(B)(2) NEW DRUG APPLICATION FOR SEQUESTOXTM, AFTER RECEIVING A WAIVER OF THE $2.3 MILLION FILING FEE  FROM THE FDA. IN MARCH 2016, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF THE FDA\\u2019S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS FILING AND THAT SUCH FILING  HAS BEEN GRANTED PRIORITY REVIEW BY THE FDA WITH A TARGET ACTION UNDER THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT (\\u201cPDUFA\\u201d)  OF JULY 14, 2016.  ON JULY 15, 2016,  THE FDA ISSUED A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER, OR CRL, REGARDING THE NDA. THE CRL STATED THAT THE REVIEW CYCLE FOR THE SEQUESTOXTM  NDA IS COMPLETE AND THE APPLICATION IS NOT READY FOR APPROVAL IN ITS PRESENT FORM.  ON DECEMBER 21, 2016,  THE COMPANY MET WITH THE FDA FOR AN END-OF-REVIEW MEETING TO DISCUSS STEPS THAT IT COULD TAKE TO OBTAIN APPROVAL OF SEQUESTOXTM.  BASED ON THIS AND THE MEETING MINUTES RECEIVED FROM THE FDA ON JANUARY 23, 2017, THE COMPANY FORMULATED A PLAN TO ADDRESS THE  ISSUES CITED BY THE FDA IN THE CRL, WITH SUCH PLAN INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, MODIFYING THE SEQUESTOXTM FORMULATION,  CONDUCTING BIOEQUIVALENCE AND BIOAVAILABILITY FED AND FASTED STUDIES, COMPARING THE MODIFIED FORMULATION TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION.  ON JULY 7, 2017, THE  COMPANY REPORTED TOPLINE RESULTS FROM A PIVOTAL BIOEQUIVALENCE FED STUDY FOR OR SEQUESTOXTM. THE MEAN TMAX (THE AMOUNT OF  TIME THAT A DRUG IS PRESENT AT THE MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION IN SERUM) OF SEQUESTOXTM WAS 4.6 HOURS WITH A RANGE OF 0.5  HOUR TO 12 HOURS AND THE MEAN TMAX OF THE COMPARATOR, ROXICODONE\\u00ae, WAS 3.4 HOURS WITH A RANGE OF 0.5 HOUR TO 12 HOURS. A KEY  OBJECTIVE FOR THE STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF THE REFORMULATED SEQUESTOXTM HAD A SIMILAR TMAX TO THE COMPARATOR WHEN TAKEN  WITH A HIGH FAT MEAL. ELITE WILL PAUSE, NOT PROCEED WITH THE REST OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS, AND SEEK CLARITY FROM FDA BEFORE DECIDING  ON THE NEXT STEPS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE SEQUESTOXTM. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE EXTENDED RELEASE PRODUCTS WITH ITS  PROPRIETARY ABUSE DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY.  ON JANUARY 30, 2018,  THE COMPANY REPORTED POSITIVE TOPLINE RESULTS FROM A PILOT STUDY CONDUCTED FOR SEQUESTOXTM. AN OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS  TO ASSESS WHETHER THE REFORMULATED SEQUESTOX COULD ACHIEVE A TMAX COMPARABLE TO THE REFERENCE DRUG, ROXICODONE, WHEN DOSED WITH  THE STANDARD HIGH FAT MEAL SPECIFIED BY FDA. AS OPPOSED TO THE EARLIER FORMULATION, BASED ON THESE PILOT RESULTS, THE MODIFIED  SEQUESTOXTM IS EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE BIOEQUIVALENCE WITH A TMAX RANGE EQUIVALENT TO THE REFERENCE PRODUCT WHEN CONDUCTED IN  A PIVOTAL TRIAL UNDER FED CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED  THE PILOT DATA TO THE FDA, REQUESTING CLARIFICATION AS TO REQUIREMENTS FOR RESUBMISSION OF THE NDA. THE FDA HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE  FOR REPEATED BIO-EQUIVALENCE STUDIES IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THE NEW FORMULATION TO THE ORIGINAL SEQUESTOX STUDIES, AND ALSO EXTENDED  OUR FILING FEE WAIVER UNTIL DECEMBER 2019.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES  OF THE SUCCESS OF ANY FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS, OR IF SUCH TRIALS ARE SUCCESSFUL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT AN INTENDED FUTURE  RESUBMISSION OF THE NDA PRODUCT FILING, IF MADE, WILL BE ACCEPTED BY OR RECEIVE MARKETING APPROVAL FROM THE FDA, AND ACCORDINGLY,  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL EARN AND RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL $7.5 MILLION OR FUTURE LICENSE FEES (SEE \\u201c  LICENSING,  MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS; SALES AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH EPIC PHARMA LLC FOR SEQUESTOXTM  \\u201d  BELOW). IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECEIVE THESE PAYMENTS OR FEES, IT WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN ADDITION, EVEN IF MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IS RECEIVED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THERE WILL BE FUTURE REVENUES OR PROFITS,  OR THAT ANY SUCH FUTURE REVENUES OR PROFITS WOULD BE IN AMOUNTS THAT PROVIDE ADEQUATE RETURN ON THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS MADE  TO SECURE THIS MARKETING AUTHORIZATION.

AS OF THE DATE OF FILING OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED $7.5 MILLION  OF THE $15 MILLION IN NON-REFUNDABLE PAYMENTS DUE PURSUANT TO THE 2015 SEQUESTOXTM LICENSE AGREEMENT, WITH SUCH AMOUNT CONSISTING  OF $5 MILLION BEING DUE AND OWING ON THE EXECUTION DATE OF THE 2015 SEQUESTOXTM LICENSE AGREEMENT, AND $2.5 MILLION BEING  EARNED AS OF JANUARY 14, 2016, THE DATE OF ELITE\\u2019S FILING OF AN NDA WITH THE FDA FOR THE RELEVANT PRODUCT.

PLEASE NOTE THAT ON  JULY 15, 2016, THE FDA ISSUED A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER, OR CRL, REGARDING THE NDA. THE CRL STATED THAT THE REVIEW CYCLE FOR  THE SEQUESTOXTM NDA IS COMPLETE AND THE APPLICATION IS NOT READY FOR APPROVAL IN ITS PRESENT FORM. BASED ON SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS  AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE FDA, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A CLEAR PATH FORWARD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES CITED IN THE CRL.

STRATEGIC MARKETING  ALLIANCE WITH GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. USA  ON MAY 29, 2018, WE  ENTERED INTO A LICENSE, MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH GLENMARK PHARMACEUTICALS INC. USA (\\u201cGLENMARK\\u201d) TO  MARKET THE TWO ELITE GENERIC PRODUCTS DESCRIBED BELOW IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THE OPTION TO ADD PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE (THE  \\u201cGLENMARK ALLIANCE\\u201d).  PURSUANT TO THE GLENMARK  ALLIANCE, GLENMARK WILL PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS FROM ELITE AND THEN SELL AND DISTRIBUTE THEM. IN ADDITION TO THE PURCHASE PRICES  FOR THE PRODUCTS, ELITE WILL RECEIVE LICENSE FEES WELL IN EXCESS OF 50% OF GROSS PROFITS. GROSS PROFITS ARE DEFINED AS NET SALES  LESS THE PRICE PAID TO ELITE FOR THE PRODUCTS, DISTRIBUTION FEES (LESS THAN 10%) AND SHIPPING COSTS. GLENMARK WILL HAVE SEMI-EXCLUSIVE  MARKETING RIGHTS TO THE ANDA APPROVED GENERIC PRODUCT, PHENDIMETRAZINE 35MG TABLETS, AND EXCLUSIVE MARKETING RIGHTS TO METHADONE  5MG AND 10MG, PRODUCTS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE FDA ON AUGUST 3, 2018. COLLECTIVELY, THE BRAND PRODUCTS AND THEIR GENERIC EQUIVALENTS  HAD TOTAL ANNUAL SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $33.6 MILLION IN 2017, ACCORDING TO QUINTILES IMS HEALTH DATA. THE AGREEMENT HAS AN INITIAL  TERM OF THREE YEARS AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS FOR ONE-YEAR PERIODS ABSENT PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE OF NON-RENEWAL. IN ADDITION TO CUSTOMARY  TERMINATION PROVISIONS, THE AGREEMENT PERMITS GLENMARK TO TERMINATE WITH REGARD TO A PRODUCT ON AT LEAST THREE MONTHS\\u2019 PRIOR  WRITTEN NOTICE IF IT DETERMINES TO STOP MARKETING AND SELLING SUCH PRODUCT, AND IT PERMITS ELITE TO TERMINATE WITH REGARD TO A  PRODUCT IF AT ANY TIME AFTER THE FIRST TWELVEMONTHS FROM THE FIRST COMMERCIAL SALE, THE AVERAGE LICENSE FEE PAID BY GLENMARK FOR  SUCH PRODUCT IS LESS THAN A DEFINED MINIMUM AMOUNT.  PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT  ELITE\\u2019S RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING ITS PROPRIETARY ABUSE DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY AND THE DEVELOPMENT  OF A RANGE OF ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOID PRODUCTS THAT UTILIZE THIS TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER APPROACHES TO ABUSE DETERRENCE.  ELITE\\u2019S PROPRIETARY  ABUSE-DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY UTILIZES THE PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH TO ABUSE DETERRENCE AND CONSISTS OF A MULTI-PARTICULATE CAPSULE  WHICH CONTAINS AN OPIOID AGONIST IN ADDITION TO NALTREXONE, AN OPIOID ANTAGONIST USED PRIMARILY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE  AND OPIOID DEPENDENCE. WHEN THIS PRODUCT IS TAKEN AS INTENDED, THE NALTREXONE IS DESIGNED TO PASS THROUGH THE BODY UNRELEASED  WHILE THE OPIOID AGONIST RELEASES OVER TIME PROVIDING THERAPEUTIC PAIN RELIEF FOR WHICH IT IS PRESCRIBED. IF THE MULTI-PARTICULATE  BEADS ARE CRUSHED OR DISSOLVED, THE OPIOID ANTAGONIST, NALTREXONE, IS DESIGNED TO RELEASE. THE ABSORPTION OF THE NALTREXONE IS  INTENDED TO BLOCK THE EUPHORIA BY PREFERENTIALLY BINDING TO SAME RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN AS THE OPIOID AGONIST AND THEREBY REDUCING  THE INCENTIVE FOR ABUSE OR MISUSE BY RECREATIONAL DRUG ABUSERS.  WE FILED AN NDA FOR  THE FIRST PRODUCT TO UTILIZE OUR ABUSE DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY, IMMEDIATE RELEASE OXYCODONE 5MG, 10MG, 15MG, 20MG AND 30MG WITH SEQUESTERED  NALTREXONE (COLLECTIVELY AND INDIVIDUALLY REFERRED TO AS \\u201cSEQUESTOXTM\\u201d), ON JANUARY 14, 2016.

AN ADDITIONAL $7.5 MILLION NON-REFUNDABLE MILESTONE IS DUE UPON THE FDA\\u2019S APPROVAL OF ELITE\\u2019S NDA. PLEASE  NOTE, AS FURTHER DETAILED ABOVE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES OF THE COMPANY RECEIVING MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR SEQUESTOXTM,  AND ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL EARN AND RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL $7.5 MILLION OR FUTURE LICENSE  FEES. THE NON-RECEIPT BY THE COMPANY OF THESE PAYMENTS AND OR FEES WILL MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  PLEASE NOTE THAT,  WHILE THE FDA IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS WITHIN CERTAIN TIMEFRAMES, DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS, THE FDA FREQUENTLY REQUESTS  THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BE SUBMITTED. THE EFFECT OF SUCH REQUEST AND SUBSEQUENT SUBMISSION CAN SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND THE TIME  FOR THE NDA REVIEW PROCESS. UNTIL AN NDA IS ACTUALLY APPROVED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE INFORMATION REQUESTED AND SUBMITTED  WILL BE CONSIDERED ADEQUATE BY THE FDA TO JUSTIFY APPROVAL. THE PACKAGING AND LABELING OF OUR DEVELOPED PRODUCTS ARE ALSO SUBJECT  TO FDA REGULATION. BASED ON THE FOREGOING, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ANTICIPATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO OBTAIN FDA  APPROVAL TO MARKET ANY PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES OF THE COMPANY FILING THE REQUIRED APPLICATION(S) WITH  THE FDA OR OF THE FDA APPROVING SUCH APPLICATION(S) IF FILED, AND THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE  PRODUCTS INCORPORATING ITS ABUSE DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY IS SUBJECT TO A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK AS DETAILED IN \\u201cITEM 1A-RISK FACTORS-RISKS  RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\\u201d OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FILED WITH THE SEC ON JUNE 14, 2018.  ABUSE-DETERRENT AND SUSTAINED RELEASE  OPIOIDS  THE ABUSE-DETERRENT  OPIOID PRODUCTS UTILIZE OUR PATENTED ABUSE-DETERRENT TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BASED ON A PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH. THESE PRODUCTS ARE  COMBINATIONS OF A NARCOTIC AGONIST FORMULATION INTENDED FOR USE IN PATIENTS WITH PAIN, AND AN ANTAGONIST, FORMULATED TO DETER  ABUSE OF THE DRUG. BOTH, AGONIST AND ANTAGONIST, HAVE BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND SOLD SEPARATELY IN VARIOUS  DOSE STRENGTHS. WE HAVE FILED INDS FOR TWO ABUSE RESISTANT PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND HAVE TESTED PRODUCTS IN VARIOUS PHARMACOKINETIC  AND EFFICACY STUDIES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP MULTIPLE ABUSE RESISTANT PRODUCTS. PRODUCTS UTILIZING THE PHARMACOLOGICAL  APPROACH TO DETER ABUSE SUCH AS SUBOXONE\\u00ae, A PRODUCT MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES BY RECKITT BENCKISER PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.,  AND EMBEDA\\u00ae, A PRODUCT MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES BY PFIZER, INC., HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA AND ARE BEING MARKETED  IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE DEVELOPED, LICENSED TO EPIC THE MARKETING RIGHTS TO SEQUESTOXTM, IMMEDIATE RELEASE OXYCODONE  WITH NALTREXONE, AND RETAIN THE RIGHTS TO THE REMAINDER OF THESE ABUSE RESISTANT AND SUSTAINED RELEASE OPIOID PRODUCTS. WE MAY  LICENSE THESE PRODUCTS AT A LATER DATE TO A THIRD PARTY WHO COULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE REMAINING CLINICAL STUDIES AND WHO COULD  PROVIDE SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FOR THE PRODUCT.  WE ALSO DEVELOPED  CONTROLLED RELEASE TECHNOLOGY FOR OXYCODONE UNDER A JOINT VENTURE WITH ELAN WHICH TERMINATED IN 2002.

MANUFACTURING FEES  INCREASED BY $0.02 MILLION, OR 1%, DUE TO THE METHADONE LAUNCH, AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED ABOVE.  LICENSING FEES INCREASED  BY $0.1 MILLION, OR 30%. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF IN-MARKET SALES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S GENERIC PRODUCTS,  ESPECIALLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION, GENERIC ISRADIPINE, PHENTERMINE AND NALTREXONE, AS WELL AS MARGINS ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY\\u2019S  LICENSED MARKETING PARTNERS. LICENSE FEES EARNED ARE BASED ON IN-MARKET SALES AND ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS A NATURAL LAG BETWEEN  MANUFACTURING REVENUES EARNED BY THE COMPANY AND RELATED LICENSE FEES BEING EARNED FROM IN MARKET SALES OCCURRING SUBSEQUENT TO  THE COMPANY\\u2019S SHIPMENT OF LICENSED GENERIC PRODUCTS TO ITS MARKETING PARTNERS. IN MARKET PROFITS ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY\\u2019S  MARKETING PARTNERS ARE ALSO A FACTOR, WITH A DIRECT CORRELATION TO THE LICENSE FEE REVENUES EARNED BY THE COMPANY.  COSTS OF REVENUE CONSISTS  OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY COSTS. OUR COSTS OF REVENUE INCREASED BY $0.4 MILLION OR 25%, TO $1.8 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $1.4  MILLION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2017. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE IN LARGE PART TO MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS CONSISTING OF A  GREATER PROPORTION OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. COSTS OF REVENUE CONSISTS OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY  COSTS, WITH THERE BEING A STRONG CORRELATION WITH MANUFACTURING FEES, AS WELL AS THE PRODUCT COMPONENTS OF  SUCH MANUFACTURING FEES.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  WAS 34% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO 44% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE  DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN IS DUE TO THE PRODUCT MIX OF GENERICS MANUFACTURED DURING THE QUARTER.  OPERATING EXPENSES.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME WAS DUE TO  DERIVATIVE INCOME RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED IN LARGE PART BY THE NUMBER OF WARRANTS  OUTSTANDING AND THE CHANGE IN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD, AS COMPARED TO  THE CLOSING PRICE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, WITH A STRONG INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES  INSTRUMENTS AND INCREASES IN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK.

MANUFACTURING FEES  INCREASED BY $0.3 MILLION, OR 7%, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN FEES EARNED FROM THE MANUFACTURE OF GENERIC NALTREXONE.  LICENSING FEES INCREASED  BY $0.1 MILLION, OR 4%. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF IN-MARKET SALES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S GENERIC PRODUCTS,  ESPECIALLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION, GENERIC ISRADIPINE AND PHENTERMINE, AS WELL AS MARGINS ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY\\u2019S LICENSED  MARKETING PARTNERS.

IN MARKET PROFITS ACHIEVED BY THE COMPANY\\u2019S MARKETING PARTNERS  ARE ALSO A FACTOR, WITH A DIRECT CORRELATION TO THE LICENSE FEE REVENUES EARNED BY THE COMPANY.  OUR COSTS OF REVENUE  INCREASED BY $0.8 MILLION OR 28%, TO $3.9 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $3.0 MILLION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2017.

THE  DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN IS DUE TO THE PRODUCT MIX OF GENERICS MANUFACTURED DURING THE PERIOD, WITH THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD SPECIFICALLY  CONSISTING OF A GREATER PROPORTION OF NALTREXONE MANUFACTURING AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. .

THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO THE TIMING AND COMPOSITION OF ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF  OUR ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOID, PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT PURSUANT TO THE SUNGEN AGREEMENT AND OTHER PRODUCTS.  17  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WERE $2.2 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $0.2 MILLION OR 9% FROM $2.1 MILLION OF  SUCH COSTS FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR WITH SUCH INCREASE BEING PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  COSTS.  NON-CASH COMPENSATION  EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 WAS $0.1 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN  NON-CASH COMPENSATION EXPENSE DERIVES FROM THE TIMING IN AMORTIZATION OF THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED OVER THE COURSE  OF THE LAST THREE YEARS.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME WAS DUE TO  DERIVATIVE INCOME RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  TOTALING A DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME OF $4.0 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. PLEASE NOTE THAT DERIVATIVE INCOME (EXPENSES)  IS DETERMINED IN LARGE PART BY THE NUMBER OF WARRANTS OUTSTANDING AND THE CHANGE IN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON  STOCK AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD, AS COMPARED TO THE CLOSING PRICE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, WITH A STRONG INVERSE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN DERIVATIVE REVENUES AND INCREASES IN THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK. PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE  WARRANTS RELATED TO REVENUES EARNED IN RELATION TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017 HAD SUBSTANTIALLY BEEN EXERCISED OR EXPIRED PRIOR TO THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND ACCORDINGLY  HAD NO IMPACT ON OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER.

WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH RESOURCES, COMBINED WITH THE COMPANY\\u2019S ACCESS TO PART OR ALL OF THE  REMAINING $36.0 MILLION AVAILABLE PURSUANT TO THE $40 MILLION EQUITY LINE WITH LINCOLN PARK IS SUFFICIENT TO FUND OPERATIONS THROUGH  THE CURRENT OPERATING CYCLE. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS TOTALING $7.1 MILLION,  AND NET OTHER INCOME TOTALING $0.5 MILLION, RESULTING IN A NET LOSS OF $6.6 MILLION.  18  THE COMPANY DOES NOT  ANTICIPATE BEING PROFITABLE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2019, DUE IN LARGE PART TO ITS PLANS TO CONDUCT CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT  AND COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES ON A RANGE OF ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOID PRODUCTS, ON AN ACCELERATED AND SIMULTANEOUS BASIS. SUCH  ACTIVITIES REQUIRE THE INVESTMENT OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS, SAFETY AND EFFICACY STUDIES, BIOEQUIVALENCE STUDIES,  PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, REGULATORY EXPERTISE AND FILINGS, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN MANUFACTURING AND LAB EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE.  IN ORDER TO FINANCE THESE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH LINCOLN PARK CAPITAL  FUND, WITH SUCH AGREEMENT PROVIDING THE COMPANY WITH AN EQUITY LINE TOTALING $40 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THIS AMOUNT OF FINANCING,  IF RECEIVED, IS SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOID PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES  IT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR AGGREGATING ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS INTO A SINGLE REPORTING SEGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING  GUIDANCE. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE  DURGIN-PARK  PROFITABLY DUE  TO DECREASED TRAFFIC AT THE FANEUIL HALL MARKETPLACE IN BOSTON, MA, WHERE IT IS LOCATED, AND RISING LABOR COSTS. AS A RESULT, INCLUDED  IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 IS A LOSS ON CLOSURE IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,067,000 CONSISTING  OF: (I) IMPAIRMENT OF TRADEMARKS IN THE AMOUNT OF $721,000, (II) ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS IN THE AMOUNT OF $333,000,  AND (III) WRITE-OFFS OF PREPAID EXPENSES IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,000.

AT OUR PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE NORTHEAST, THE FIRST AND SECOND FISCAL QUARTERS, WHICH  INCLUDE THE WINTER MONTHS, USUALLY REFLECT LOWER CUSTOMER TRAFFIC THAN IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS. HOWEVER, SALES  IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCLEMENT WEATHER DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUTDOOR  SEATING AT THE COMPANY\\u2019S RESTAURANTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 WAS $305,000, WHICH INCLUDED A LOSS OF $1,067,000 RELATING TO THE CLOSURE OF  DURGIN-PARK  LOCATED IN BOSTON, MA.

COSTS AND EXPENSES  COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR THE  13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 AND DECEMBER 30, 2017 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  13 WEEKS  ENDED  DECEMBER 29,%  TO TOTAL  13 WEEKS  ENDED  DECEMBER 30,%  TO TOTAL  INCREASE  (DECREASE)  2018  REVENUES  2017  REVENUES  $%  FOOD AND BEVERAGE COST OF SALES  $10,476  25.8%  $10,218  26.0%  $258  2.5%  PAYROLL EXPENSES  14,105  34.8%  13,710  34.9%  395  2.9%  OCCUPANCY EXPENSES  5,005  12.3%  5,031  12.8%  (26  )  -0.5%  OTHER OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES  4,975  12.3%  5,117  13.0%  (142  )  -2.8%  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  3,409  8.4%  3,079  7.8%  330  10.7%  LOSS ON CLOSURE OF DURGIN-PARK  1,067  2.6%  -  0.0%  1,067  N/A  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  1,206  3.0%  1,303  3.3%  (97  )  -7.4%  $40,243  $38,458  $1,785  -  15  -  FOOD AND BEVERAGE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF  TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR AS EXPECTED.  PAYROLL EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES  FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF MINIMUM WAGE  INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES TO LABOR LAWS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BETTER MIX OF CATERING VERSUS A LA CARTE BUSINESS AT OUR  LARGER PROPERTIES.  OCCUPANCY EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL  REVENUES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DECREASED SLIGHTLY AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR PRIMARILY AS A  RESULT OF HIGHER SALES AT PROPERTIES WHERE RENTS ARE RELATIVELY FIXED OR WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS THE PREMISES AT WHICH THE PROPERTY  OPERATES.  OTHER OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE  OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DECREASED AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF  INCREASED SALES AS MANY OF THESE COSTS ARE FIXED.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (WHICH  RELATE SOLELY TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE IN NEW YORK CITY) AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  INCREASED AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ANNUAL WAGE INCREASES AND HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THE  13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DECREASED AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ASSETS BECOMING  FULLY DEPRECIATED IN THE PRIOR PERIOD PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DEPRECIATION ON THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE AT THE  SEQUOIA  PROPERTY  WHICH WERE PLACED IN SERVICE IN THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2017.  INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY\\u2019S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  CONSISTS OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES IN AMOUNTS NECESSARY TO ALIGN THE COMPANY\\u2019S YEAR-TO-DATE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES WITH THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE FOR THE FULL YEAR. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY UPDATES ITS  ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND RECORDS CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS AS DEEMED NECESSARY.  THE INCOME TAX PROVISIONS FOR THE 13 WEEK PERIODS  ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 AND DECEMBER 30, 2017 REFLECT EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF APPROXIMATELY 287.5% AND (162.5)%, RESPECTIVELY. THE  COMPANY\\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DIFFERED THAN THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21% AS A RESULT  OF THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE GENERATION OF FICA TAX CREDITS AND OPERATING INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS  THAT IS NOT TAXABLE TO THE COMPANY. THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2017 DIFFERED FROM THE BLENDED STATUTORY  RATE OF 24% AS A RESULT OF TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE GENERATION OF FICA TAX CREDITS, OPERATING INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING  INTERESTS THAT IS NOT TAXABLE TO THE COMPANY AND THE ONE-TIME REMEASUREMENT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  FOR REDUCED FEDERAL TAX RATE ENACTED AS PART OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. THE FINAL ANNUAL TAX RATE CANNOT BE DETERMINED UNTIL  THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR; THEREFORE, THE ACTUAL TAX RATE COULD DIFFER FROM CURRENT ESTIMATES.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S OVERALL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  IN THE FUTURE WILL BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS THE UTILIZATION OF STATE AND LOCAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, THE GENERATION  OF FICA TAX CREDITS AND THE MIX OF EARNINGS BY STATE TAXING JURISDICTIONS AS NEVADA DOES NOT IMPOSE A STATE INCOME TAX, AS COMPARED  TO THE OTHER MAJOR STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CAPITAL HAS BEEN CASH  PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND, IN RECENT YEARS, BANK AND OTHER BORROWINGS TO FINANCE SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS, ACQUISITIONS AND LARGE  REMODELING PROJECTS. WE UTILIZE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS TO FUND THE COST OF DEVELOPING AND OPENING NEW RESTAURANTS AND SMALLER  REMODELING PROJECTS OF EXISTING RESTAURANTS WE OWN.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR  THE 13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 DECREASED TO $840,000 AS COMPARED TO $1,165,000 PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS IN THE SAME PERIOD  OF LAST YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN NET WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID,  REFUNDABLE AND ACCRUED INCOME TAXES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  13 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 AND DECEMBER 30, 2017 WERE $619,000 AND $2,516,000, RESPECTIVELY AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM PURCHASES  OF FIXED ASSETS AT EXISTING RESTAURANTS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE 13 WEEK PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 AND DECEMBER 30, 2017 OF ($2,050,000) AND $98,000, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTED PRIMARILY  FROM THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON NOTES PAYABLE AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS, OFFSET BY BORROWINGS  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  -  16  -  THE COMPANY HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIENCY  OF $4,210,000 AT DECEMBER 29, 2018 AS COMPARED WITH A DEFICIENCY OF $4,628,000 AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2018. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING  CASH BALANCES, CURRENT BANKING FACILITIES AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  SPENDING REQUIREMENTS AT LEAST THROUGH FEBRUARY 12, 2020.  ON DECEMBER 3, 2018, THE  BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.25 PER SHARE ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK TO BE PAID ON JANUARY 3,  2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON DECEMBER 18, 2018. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PAY SUCH QUARTERLY  CASH DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE; HOWEVER, THE PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IS BASED ON FUTURE EARNINGS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN U.S. TAXATION  AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF ITS  FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE REVOLVING FACILITY AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018.  RECENT RESTAURANT DISPOSITIONS  AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, THE COMPANY DETERMINED  THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE  DURGIN-PARK  PROFITABLY DUE TO DECREASED TRAFFIC AT THE FANEUIL HALL MARKETPLACE IN  BOSTON, MA, WHERE IT IS LOCATED, AND RISING LABOR COSTS. AS A RESULT, INCLUDED IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 13 WEEKS  ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 IS A LOSS ON CLOSURE IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,067,000 CONSISTING OF: (I) IMPAIRMENT OF TRADEMARKS IN THE AMOUNT  OF $721,000, (II) ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS IN THE AMOUNT OF $333,000, AND (III) WRITE-OFFS OF PREPAID EXPENSES  IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,000. THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED ON JANUARY 12, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES  THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS.  IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING ITS CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE APPROPRIATE CARRYING VALUE  OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. THE PRIMARY ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE COMPANY\\u2019S  CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE ALLOWANCES FOR POTENTIAL BAD DEBTS ON ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, LEASES,  THE USEFUL LIVES AND RECOVERABILITY OF ITS ASSETS, SUCH AS PROPERTY AND INTANGIBLES, FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE  REALIZABLE VALUE OF ITS TAX ASSETS AND OTHER MATTERS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH IT BELIEVES  ARE REASONABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE  THAT ANY CHANGE IN THOSE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE NEAR TERM WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  POSITION OR THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, DIFFERENCES IN ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ARE DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2018. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO  SUCH POLICIES DURING FISCAL 2019 OTHER THAN THOSE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ADOPTED AND ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE ADOPTED IN FISCAL 2019 AND THE EXPECTED DATES  OF ADOPTION AND THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"ARK RESTAURANTS CORP\", \"CIK\": 779544, \"Date\": \"2019-02-12T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"ARKR\", \"Name\": \"Ark Restaurants Corp\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 5812.0, \"Business\": \"NY\", \"Incorporated\": \"NY\", \"IRS\": 133156768.0, \"key\": \"20190212ARKR\", \"labelr1\": 9.97289972899729, \"labelr2\": -2.661409561360272, \"labelr3\": -1.2658227848101269, \"labelr4\": 0.0, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.59379154, \"prof1\": 0.40620850000000003, \"return1&2\": 0.9242309012543058, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9359300265866388, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.9359300265866388, \"return2\": 1.0266140956136027, \"return1\": 0.9002710027100271, \"return3\": 1.0126582278481011, \"return4\": 1.0, \"1_day_return\": 9.972899728997287, \"cumulative_return1\": 1.7194136339510144, \"cumulative_return1&2\": 1.6698207747642697, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": 0.7470959937451928, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.564991817044712, \"indexx\": 135, \"returnpred\": -9.97289972899729, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9842219394851218, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.0032678311487355, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9162974209703193, \"cumreturndow\": 1.017180670268484, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0191262766492386}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 146, \"level_0\": 149, \"index\": 24947, \"text\": \"ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  ESPEY MFG. & ELECTRONICS CORP. (\\u201cESPEY\\u201d)  IS A POWER ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (OEM) COMPANY WITH A LONG HISTORY OF DEVELOPING AND DELIVERING  HIGHLY RELIABLE PRODUCTS FOR USE IN MILITARY AND SEVERE ENVIRONMENT APPLICATIONS. DESIGN, MANUFACTURING, AND TESTING IS PERFORMED  IN OUR 150,000+ SQUARE FOOT FACILITY LOCATED AT 233 BALLSTON AVE, SARATOGA SPRINGS, NEW YORK. ESPEY IS CLASSIFIED AS A \\u201cSMALLER  REPORTING COMPANY\\u201d FOR PURPOSES OF THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. ESPEY\\u2019S  COMMON STOCK IS PUBLICLY-TRADED ON THE NYSE AMERICAN UNDER THE SYMBOL \\u201cESP.\\u201d  ESPEY BEGAN OPERATIONS AFTER INCORPORATION  IN NEW YORK IN 1928. WE STRIVE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AS A LEADER IN HIGH POWER ENERGY CONVERSION AND TRANSFORMER SOLUTIONS THROUGH  THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS BY USING ADVANCED AND \\u201cCUTTING EDGE\\u201d ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES.  ESPEY IS ISO 9001:2015 AND AS9100:2016 CERTIFIED.  OUR PRIMARY PRODUCTS ARE POWER SUPPLIES, POWER CONVERTERS, FILTERS, POWER TRANSFORMERS, MAGNETIC COMPONENTS, POWER DISTRIBUTION  EQUIPMENT, UPS SYSTEMS, ANTENNAS AND HIGH POWER RADAR SYSTEMS. THE APPLICATIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE AC AND DC LOCOMOTIVES,  SHIPBOARD POWER, SHIPBOARD RADAR, AIRBORNE POWER, GROUND-BASED RADAR, AND GROUND MOBILE POWER.  ESPEY SERVICES INCLUDE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT  TO SPECIFICATION, BUILD TO PRINT, DESIGN SERVICES, DESIGN STUDIES, ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING SERVICES, METAL FABRICATION, PAINTING  SERVICES, AND DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATIC TESTING EQUIPMENT. ESPEY IS VERTICALLY INTEGRATED, MEANING THAT THE COMPANY PRODUCES INDIVIDUAL  COMPONENTS (INCLUDING INDUCTORS), POPULATES PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS, FABRICATES METALWORK, PAINTS, WIRES, QUALIFIES, AND FULLY TESTS  ITEMS, MECHANICALLY, ELECTRICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY, IN HOUSE. PORTIONS OF THE MANUFACTURING AND TESTING PROCESS ARE SUBCONTRACTED  TO VENDORS FROM TIME TO TIME.  THE COMPANY MARKETS ITS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY  THROUGH ITS OWN DIRECT SALES ORGANIZATION AND THROUGH OUTSIDE SALES REPRESENTATIVES. BUSINESS IS SOLICITED FROM LARGE INDUSTRIAL  MANUFACTURERS AND DEFENSE COMPANIES, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND MAJOR FOREIGN ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT  COMPANIES. ESPEY IS ALSO ON THE ELIGIBLE LIST OF CONTRACTORS WITH THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. WE PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES  FOR PRIME CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND ARE GENERALLY AUTOMATICALLY SOLICITED BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE  PROCUREMENT AGENCIES FOR THEIR NEEDS FALLING WITHIN THE MAJOR CLASSES OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE COMPANY. ESPEY CONTRACTS WITH  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER CAGE CODE 20950 AS ESPEY MFG. & ELECTRONICS CORP.  THERE IS COMPETITION IN ALL CLASSES OF PRODUCTS  MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, RANGING FROM DIVISIONS OF THE LARGEST ELECTRONIC COMPANIES, TO MANY SMALL COMPANIES. THE COMPANY'S  SALES DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE INDUSTRY'S MARKET FOR ANY CLASS OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION  FOR ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS OF BOTH A MILITARY AND INDUSTRIAL NATURE INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, PRICE, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, THE  EXPERIENCE OF THE PARTICULAR COMPANY AND HISTORY OF ITS DEALINGS IN SUCH PRODUCTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS NOT SEASONAL. HOWEVER, THE  CONCENTRATION OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE RAIL INDUSTRY, AND IN EQUIPMENT FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, AND  OUR CUSTOMER CONCENTRATIONS EXPOSE US TO ON-GOING ASSOCIATED RISKS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REQUIREMENTS FOR POWER  SUPPLIES IN THE RAIL INDUSTRY, DEPENDENCE ON APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENTS OF FOREIGN NATIONS,  PROGRAM ALLOCATIONS, THE POTENTIAL OF GOVERNMENTAL TERMINATION OF ORDERS FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THE GENERAL STRENGTH OF THE INDUSTRY  SECTORS IN WHICH OUR CUSTOMERS TRANSACT BUSINESS.  IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR NEW BUSINESS,  IN SOME CASES WE HAVE INVESTED IN UPFRONT DESIGN COSTS, THEREBY REDUCING INITIAL PROFITABILITY AS A MEANS OF PROCURING NEW LONG-TERM  PROGRAMS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY, WE ADJUST OUR PRICING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A BALANCE WHICH ENABLES US BOTH TO RETAIN REPEAT PROGRAMS  WHILE BEING MORE COMPETITIVE IN BIDDING ON NEW PROGRAMS.  IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED BUSINESS, WE  ARE CONTINUING TO PLACE AN EMPHASIS ON SECURING \\u201cBUILD TO PRINT\\u201d OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH WILL ALLOW PRODUCTION WORK TO  GO DIRECTLY TO THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR, LIMITING THE IMPACT ON OUR ENGINEERING STAFF. THIS EFFORT WILL KEEP OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM  BUSY WHILE THE PRODUCTS BEING DEVELOPED TRANSITION TO PRODUCTION.  9  INDEX  THE TOTAL BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS  APPROXIMATELY $45.8 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $24.0 MILLION FROM THREE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, COMPARED TO $38.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER  31, 2017, WHICH INCLUDED $19.0 MILLION FROM THREE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY\\u2019S TOTAL BACKLOG REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED  REMAINING SALES VALUE OF WORK TO BE PERFORMED UNDER FIRM CONTRACTS. THE FUNDED PORTION OF THIS BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 IS  APPROXIMATELY $42.9 MILLION. THIS INCLUDES ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED AND APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS AND/OR FUNDED BY THE CUSTOMER.  THE UNFUNDED BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 IS APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION AND REPRESENTS A FIRM MULTI-YEAR ORDER FOR WHICH FUNDING  HAS NOT YET BEEN APPROPRIATED BY CONGRESS OR FUNDED BY OUR CUSTOMER. WHILE THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT FUTURE BUDGETS AND APPROPRIATIONS  WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS, MANAGEMENT HAS INCLUDED IN UNFUNDED BACKLOG ONLY THOSE PROGRAMS THAT IT BELIEVES  ARE LIKELY TO RECEIVE FUNDING BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH CUSTOMERS AND PROGRAM STATUS. THE UNFUNDED BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2017  WAS $5.0 MILLION. FOR BOTH FISCAL PERIODS ENDED 2018 AND 2017, THE UNFUNDED BACKLOG IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF THE SAME MULTI-YEAR  ORDER FROM A SINGLE CUSTOMER.  SUCCESSFUL CONVERSION OF ENGINEERING PROGRAM  BACKLOG INTO SALES IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE EXECUTION AND COMPLETION OF OUR ENGINEERING DESIGN EFFORTS.   IT IS NOT  UNCOMMON TO EXPERIENCE TECHNICAL OR SCHEDULING DELAYS WHICH ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF, AMONG OTHER REASONS, DESIGN  COMPLEXITY, THE AVAILABILITY OF PERSONNEL WITH THE REQUISITE EXPERTISE, AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN CUSTOMER APPROVAL AT VARIOUS  MILESTONES.  COST OVERRUNS WHICH MAY ARISE FROM TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE DELAYS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TIMING OF THE CONVERSION  OF BACKLOG INTO SALES, OR THE PROFITABILITY OF SUCH SALES.  WHILE RECENTLY, WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING SOME TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE  DELAYS WITH OUR MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, THESE DELAYS ARE BEING RESOLVED AS THEY ARISE AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT ANY NEGATIVE  IMPACT ON OUR CUSTOMER ORDER FULFILLMENT PROJECTIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. ENGINEERING PROGRAMS IN BOTH THE FUNDED AND UNFUNDED  PORTIONS OF THE CURRENT BACKLOG AGGREGATE $6.7 MILLION.  MANAGEMENT EXPECTS REVENUES  IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 TO BE HIGHER THAN REVENUES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018 BUT EXPECTS THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN TO BE LOWER IN FISCAL  YEAR 2019 THAN THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018. THIS EXPECTATION IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER PROFIT MARGIN ORDERS  ALREADY IN OUR BACKLOG THAT WILL BE SHIPPED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. AS MARKET FACTORS INCLUDING COMPETITION AND PRODUCT COSTS  IMPACT GROSS PROFIT MARGINS, MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR SALES STRATEGY, EMPLOYMENT LEVELS, AND FACILITY COSTS.  NEW ORDERS RECEIVED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE APPROXIMATELY $13.4 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $14.3 MILLION OF NEW ORDERS RECEIVED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2018. IT IS PRESENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT A MINIMUM OF $24.4 MILLION OF ORDERS COMPRISING THE DECEMBER 31, 2018 BACKLOG  WILL BE FILLED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2019. THE MINIMUM OF $24.4 MILLION DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY SHIPMENTS, WHICH  MAY BE MADE AGAINST ORDERS SUBSEQUENTLY RECEIVED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2019. THE ESTIMATE OF THE DECEMBER 31,  2018 BACKLOG TO BE SHIPPED IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 IS SUBJECT TO FUTURE EVENTS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THE BACKLOG ACTUALLY  SHIPPED TO DIFFER FROM SUCH ESTIMATE.  IN ADDITION TO THE BACKLOG, THE COMPANY  CURRENTLY HAS OUTSTANDING OPPORTUNITIES REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY $60.0 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 FOR  BOTH REPEAT AND NEW PROGRAMS.  THE OUTSTANDING QUOTATIONS ENCOMPASS VARIOUS NEW AND PREVIOUSLY MANUFACTURED POWER  SUPPLIES, TRANSFORMERS, AND SUBASSEMBLIES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL ACQUIRE ANY OF THE  ANTICIPATED ORDERS DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANY OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO ALLOCATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES DEFENSE SPENDING AND  FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  BUSINESS IS THE PRODUCTION OF MILITARY AND INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT FOR USE BY THE U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND CERTAIN  INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS. NET SALES TO TWO SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 49.4% OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S TOTAL SALES FOR THE THREE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND NET SALES TO THREE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 63.2% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL SALES FOR  THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. NET SALES TO TWO SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 54.4% AND 61.0% OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  TOTAL SALES FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THIS HIGH CONCENTRATION LEVEL WITH THESE CUSTOMERS  PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT RISK. A LOSS OF ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS OR PROGRAMS RELATED TO THESE CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE  COMPANY. HISTORICALLY, A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S TOTAL SALES IN  ANY GIVEN FISCAL YEAR.  10  INDEX  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING  POLICIES INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION AND COST ESTIMATION ON OUR CONTRACTS.  REVENUE  THE MAJORITY OF OUR NET SALES IS GENERATED  FROM CONTRACTS WITH INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURERS AND DEFENSE COMPANIES, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, OTHER AGENCIES OF THE GOVERNMENT  OF THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS. CONTRACTS MAY BE LONG-TERM  IN NATURE. WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS. UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS  WE AGREE TO PERFORM THE SPECIFIED WORK FOR A PRE-DETERMINED PRICE. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACTUAL COSTS VARY FROM THE ESTIMATES UPON  WHICH THE PRICE WAS NEGOTIATED, WE WILL GENERATE MORE OR LESS PROFIT OR COULD INCUR A LOSS.  WE ACCOUNT FOR A CONTRACT AFTER IT HAS BEEN  APPROVED BY ALL PARTIES TO THE ARRANGEMENT, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES ARE IDENTIFIED, PAYMENT TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE CONTRACT  HAS COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE, AND COLLECTABILITY OF CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLE. WE ASSESS EACH CONTRACT AT ITS INCEPTION TO DETERMINE  WHETHER IT SHOULD BE COMBINED WITH OTHER CONTRACTS. WHEN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS WHETHER TWO OR  MORE CONTRACTS WERE NEGOTIATED AND EXECUTED AT OR NEAR THE SAME TIME, OR WERE NEGOTIATED WITH AN OVERALL PROFIT OBJECTIVE.  WE EVALUATE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROMISED  IN EACH CONTRACT AT INCEPTION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONTRACT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS HAVING ONE OR MORE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR EACH CONTRACT BASED  ON THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE FOR THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED UNDER THE CONTRACT. THE TRANSACTION PRICE  FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE UNDERLYING EACH PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION. TRANSACTION PRICES ON OUR CONTRACTS SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON ESTIMATED  COSTS PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT MARGIN.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE USING THE OUTPUT METHOD  BASED ON THE APPRAISAL OF RESULTS ACHIEVED AND MILESTONES REACHED OR UNITS DELIVERED BASED ON CONTRACTUAL SHIPMENT TERMS, TYPICALLY  SHIPPING POINT.  INVENTORY  INVENTORIED WORK RELATING TO CONTRACTS  IN PROCESS AND WORK IN PROCESS IS VALUED AT ACTUAL PRODUCTION COST, INCLUDING FACTORY OVERHEAD INCURRED TO DATE. CONTRACT COSTS  INCLUDE MATERIAL, SUBCONTRACT COSTS, LABOR, AND AN ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD COSTS. WORK IN PROCESS REPRESENTS SPARE UNITS AND PARTS  AND OTHER INVENTORY ITEMS ACQUIRED OR PRODUCED TO SERVICE UNITS PREVIOUSLY SOLD OR TO MEET ANTICIPATED FUTURE ORDERS. PROVISION  FOR LOSSES ON CONTRACTS IS MADE WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH LOSSES BECOMES PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE.  THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES  ON CONTRACTS IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S BALANCE SHEET.  THE COSTS ATTRIBUTED TO UNITS DELIVERED  UNDER CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE COST OF ALL UNITS EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED.  CERTAIN CONTRACTS ARE EXPECTED  TO EXTEND BEYOND TWELVE MONTHS.  THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION  OF A CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS VARIABLES INVOLVING CONTRACT COSTS AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE THE  CONTRACT.  GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESSES AND JUDGMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MATERIALLY  DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF EXPECTED SALES AND CONTRACT COSTS COULD BE RECORDED IF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED, BASED ON CHANGES IN  CIRCUMSTANCES, IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS.  WHEN A CHANGE IN EXPECTED SALES VALUE OR ESTIMATED COST IS DETERMINED, CHANGES  ARE REFLECTED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS.  CONTRACT LIABILITIES  CONTRACT LIABILITIES INCLUDE ADVANCE PAYMENTS  AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.  11  INDEX  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET SALES DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $7,303,109 AS COMPARED TO $11,531,105 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. NET SALES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018 DECREASED TO $15,640,508 AS COMPARED TO $19,027,528 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018, THE DECLINE IN NET SALES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN POWER SUPPLY SHIPMENTS ON A SPECIFIC MILITARY CONTRACT AND A DECREASE  IN SHIPMENTS SUPPORTING THE RAIL INDUSTRY. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE DECREASE IN NET SALES IS PRIMARILY DUE  TO THE TIMING OF POWER SUPPLY SHIPMENTS RELATED TO A SPECIFIC MILITARY CONTRACT WHICH HAD SIGNIFICANT SHIPMENTS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL  YEAR, OFFSET IN PART BY AN INCREASE IN BUILD TO PRINT SALES. THIS DECLINE IN BOTH PERIODS IS LARGELY DUE TO TIMING OF SHIPMENTS  BASED ON CUSTOMER CONTRACTUAL DELIVERY DATES AND SHIPMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN MADE DUE TO ENGINEERING DESIGN CHANGES REQUIRED TO  MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN SUPPLIER PRODUCT NON-CONFORMANCES AND AN INCREASE IN LEAD TIMES FOR CERTAIN ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS  DUE TO INDUSTRY SHORTAGES AND VOLATILITY WITHIN THE POWER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS  AND SUPPLIERS TO EXECUTE ON OUR CURRENT PAST DUE DELIVERIES AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THIS SITUATION TO IMPACT FUTURE BUSINESS.  GROSS PROFITS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018 AND 2017 WERE $1,516,235 AND $3,075,598, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS 20.8% AND 26.7%, FOR  THE SAME PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, GROSS PROFITS WERE $2,509,169 AND $4,536,752,  RESPECTIVELY. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS 16.0% AND 23.8%, FOR THE SAME PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS  IN DETERMINING THE CHANGE IN GROSS PROFIT AND NET INCOME ARE OVERALL SALES LEVELS AND PRODUCT MIX. THE GROSS PROFITS ON MATURE  PRODUCTS AND BUILD TO PRINT CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY HIGHER AS COMPARED TO PRODUCTS WHICH ARE STILL IN THE ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT  STAGE OR IN EARLY STAGES OF PRODUCTION. IN THE CASE OF THE LATTER, THE COMPANY CAN INCUR WHAT IT REFERS TO AS \\u201cLOSS CONTRACTS,\\u201d  MEANING ENGINEERING DESIGN CONTRACTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY INVESTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING FUTURE PRODUCT SALES. IN ANY  GIVEN ACCOUNTING PERIOD THE MIX OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS BETWEEN HIGHER MARGIN PROGRAMS AND LESS MATURE PROGRAMS, AND EXPENDITURES  ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS CONTRACTS, HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GROSS PROFIT AND NET INCOME. THE GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE DECREASED  IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INCURRED  SPENDING RELATED TO A SPECIFIC ENGINEERING DESIGN CONTRACT. THIS INCREASE IN SPENDING REDUCED THE GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE BY 7.2%  AND 8.0% FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  WERE $1,295,687 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018; AN INCREASE OF $313,317, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2017. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $2,305,231 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018; AN INCREASE  OF $444,041 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED  TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017 RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDED PROGRAM MANAGEMENT  PERSONNEL SUPPORTING THE COMPANY\\u2019S SALES BACKLOG, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. THE INCREASE FOR  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017 RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASES DESCRIBED FOR  THE THREE MONTH PERIOD, HOWEVER, FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE INCREASES WERE OFFSET, IN PART, BY A REDUCTION  IN TRAVEL, AND INCURRED MARKETING COSTS.  OTHER INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 WAS $53,361 AND $43,289, RESPECTIVELY. OTHER INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017  WAS $129,432 AND $84,685, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS IS PRIMARILY DUE AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME  RESULTING FROM THE GRADUAL INCREASE IN CURRENT YIELD PERCENTAGES EARNED ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES. INTEREST INCOME IS A FUNCTION  OF THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES WHICH GENERALLY TEND TO BE CONSERVATIVE.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR  THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WERE 20.5% AND 16.2%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 24.4% AND 25.5% FOR THE THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE STATUTORY TAX RATE WAS REDUCED FROM 34% TO 21% UNDER THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE  \\u201cTAX ACT\\u2019) EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2019 IS LESS THAN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE  MAINLY DUE TO THE BENEFIT DERIVED FROM THE ESOP DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALLOCATED SHARES AND FOR THE TAX BENEFIT RECEIVED IN THE FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 IS LESS THAN THE STATUTORY TAX  RATE MAINLY DUE TO THE BENEFIT THE COMPANY RECEIVED ON ITS \\u201cQUALIFIED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES\\u201d UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS  CREATION ACT OF 2004 WHICH EXPIRED AFTER THE END OF FISCAL 2018 AND THE BENEFIT DERIVED FROM THE ESOP DIVIDENDS PAID ON ALLOCATED  SHARES.  NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018, WAS $217,758 OR $0.09 PER SHARE BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED, RESPECTIVELY COMPARED TO $1,614,871 OR $0.69 PER SHARE  BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. NET INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WAS  $279,430 OR $0.12 PER SHARE BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED COMPARED TO $2,057,635 OR $0.88 PER SHARE BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME PER SHARE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS DUE  TO LOWER SALES, LOWER GROSS PROFIT AND AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS  IN 2017 AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THESE DECREASES WERE MITIGATED, IN PART, BY AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME AND A REDUCTION IN INCOME  TAXES RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE DECREASE IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTING FROM THE DECREASE IN THE STATUTORY  TAX RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  12  INDEX  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY'S WORKING CAPITAL IS AN APPROPRIATE  INDICATOR OF THE LIQUIDITY OF ITS BUSINESS, AND DURING THE PAST TWO FISCAL YEARS, THE COMPANY, WHEN POSSIBLE, HAS FUNDED ALL OF  ITS OPERATIONS WITH CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND WHEN NECESSARY FROM ITS EXISTING CASH AND INVESTMENTS. THE  COMPANY DID NOT BORROW ANY FUNDS DURING THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. MANAGEMENT HAS AVAILABLE A $3,000,000 LINE OF CREDIT TO HELP  FUND FURTHER GROWTH OR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, IF NECESSARY, BUT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR ANY BORROWED FUNDS IN THE FORESEEABLE  FUTURE. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AGGREGATED TO ZERO AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND  2017. THE LINE OF CREDIT IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY IN NOVEMBER FOR RENEWAL BY DECEMBER 1  ST.  THE COMPANY'S WORKING CAPITAL AS OF DECEMBER  31, 2018 AND 2017 WAS APPROXIMATELY $26.7 MILLION AND $30.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE THREE AND SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FROM THE COMPANY\\u2019S EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN  AND TRUST (\\u201cESOP\\u201d). DURING THE THREE AND SIX-MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 4,798 SHARES OF  ITS COMMON STOCK FROM THE ESOP FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $109,694. UNDER EXISTING AUTHORIZATIONS FROM THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS,  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, MANAGEMENT IS AUTHORIZED TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL $876,297 OF COMPANY STOCK.  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE SUMMARY  OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOR THE FISCAL YEARS INDICATED.  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  2017  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(3,015,611  )  $596,844  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  5,379,283  (2,180,684  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (3,350,612  )  (1,272,076  )  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FLUCTUATES BETWEEN PERIODS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DIFFERENCES IN SALES AND NET INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, THE TIMING  OF THE COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PURCHASE OF INVENTORY, AND PAYMENT OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN  OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY RELATES TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME AND INCOME TAX PAYABLE AND THE INCREASE  IN INVENTORIES ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALES VOLUME AND BACKLOG INCREASES OFFSET, IN PART, BY A DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER  CURRENT ASSETS, THE COLLECTION OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AND THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATURING  INVESTMENTS OFFSET, IN PART, BY AN INCREASE IN SPENDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. THE INCREASE IN CASH  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CASH EXPENDED FOR THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND TOTALING  $1.00 PER SHARE DECLARED AND PAID IN FISCAL 2019 OFFSET, IN PART, BY PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS DURING  THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT  THE CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND WHEN NECESSARY, FROM CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS LONG-TERM  FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018 AND 2017, THE COMPANY EXPENDED $354,933 AND $185,190, RESPECTIVELY, FOR PLANT IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY  HAS BUDGETED APPROXIMATELY $750,000 FOR NEW EQUIPMENT AND PLANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019. MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT THE  FUNDS REQUIRED WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM CURRENT OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANY'S  RESERVE FOR BAD DEBTS OF $3,000 IS ADEQUATE GIVEN THE CUSTOMERS WITH WHOM THE COMPANY DOES BUSINESS. HISTORICALLY, BAD DEBT EXPENSE  HAS BEEN MINIMAL.  13  INDEX  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE \\\"SAFE  HARBOR\\\" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE  SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995  THIS REPORT CONTAINS \\\"FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS\\\" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

WE REVIEW THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN REPORTING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ON A REGULAR BASIS. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE EVALUATE OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND MAY EMPLOY OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO ASSIST IN OUR EVALUATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES WE USE ARE REASONABLE; HOWEVER, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IDENTIFY OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE THE POLICIES THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE REPRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS AND REQUIRE OUR MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.  GOING CONCERN  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS. THE GOING CONCERN BASIS ASSUMES THAT WE WILL CONTINUE IN OPERATION FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND WILL BE ABLE TO REALIZE ITS ASSETS AND DISCHARGE ITS LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  PREDICTIVE BIOTECH, INC., A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, BEGAN OPERATIONS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017. SINCE INCEPTION OF OPERATIONS, REVENUES HAVE EXCEEDED CASH EXPENSES AND SUCH EXCESS CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS OF PTG.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RAISED SUFFICIENT CAPITAL THROUGH STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR LICENSES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS PRODUCTS UNDER AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE INITIAL SALE OF SUCH PRODUCTS WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE FIRST HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2019 AND ACCELERATING THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF CALENDAR 2019.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT.  AT THE PRESENT TIME MOST SALES ARE THROUGH CREDIT CARDS, HOWEVER FROM TIME TO TIME, CREDIT IS GRANTED TO CUSTOMERS ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS WITHOUT REQUIRING COLLATERAL, AND AS SUCH, THESE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, DO NOT BEAR INTEREST, ALTHOUGH A FINANCE CHARGE MAY BE APPLIED TO SUCH RECEIVABLES THAT ARE PAST DUE.  THE COMPANY HAS IN PLACE CREDIT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SALES RETURNS AND CREDIT MEMOS.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF HCT/PS WE PRODUCE. WE VALUE INVENTORY AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. WE DETERMINE THE COST OF INVENTORY USING THE STANDARD-COST METHOD, WHICH APPROXIMATES ACTUAL COST BASED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD. ALL OTHER COSTS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  WE ANALYZE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ANNUALLY AND WRITE DOWN INVENTORY THAT HAS A COST BASIS IN EXCESS OF ITS EXPECTED NET REALIZABLE VALUE, OR THAT IS CONSIDERED IN EXCESS OF NORMAL OPERATING LEVELS, AS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT.  THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS RECEIVABLE  STOCK SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE RECORDED AS CONTRA-EQUITY ON THE DAY THE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT IS SIGNED AND ACCEPTED. ALL STOCK SUBSCRIBED AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAS BEEN COLLECTED. THE STOCK IS NOT ISSUED UNTIL SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE COLLECTED.  PREPAID EXPENSES  AMOUNTS PAID IN ADVANCE FOR EXPENSES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS PREPAID EXPENSES AND CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS IF SUCH AMOUNTS ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE WITH THE CURRENT PERIOD.  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  LAB EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE LESSER OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR LEASE TERMS. LAB EQUIPMENT ITEMS HAVE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF FIVE YEARS, FURNITURE ITEMS HAVE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF 5 TO 7 YEARS, AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT ITEMS HAVE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF 3 YEARS. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS  INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE COMPRISED OF ACQUIRED PATENTS, LICENSES, TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND AMORTIZED OVER THE SHORTER OF THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OR THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  25  LONG-LIVED ASSETS, SUCH AS PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT, AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AS WELL AS ACQUISITION COSTS OF SUBSIDIARIES, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, TYPICALLY AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, OR WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  SUCH EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY INCLUDE SWEEPING REGULATORY CHANGES, SHIFTS IN MARKET DEMAND THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE, RESTRICTIONS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, OVERALL INDUSTRY DETERIORATION, DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, RAPIDLY INCREASING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCTION INPUTS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMPANY MANAGEMENT OR COMPANY STRATEGY, AND/OR SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION.  THE COMPANY FIRST WILL ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS ABOVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST TO IDENTIFY ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS.  RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP TO ESTIMATED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS, OR FAIR VALUE, OF THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING LIVES.  THE COMPANY USED A QUALIFIED, INDEPENDENT, AND CERTIFIED THIRD-PARTY VALUATION EXPERT TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT DETERMINE FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY THEN COMPARED FAIR VALUE TO CARRYING VALUE.  OTHER THAN WHAT IS RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEEN ABOVE, THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL ASSET GROUPS IN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN OR CLOSE TO CARRYING VALUE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED THE CONVERGED STANDARD ON REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PROVIDING A SINGLE, COMPREHENSIVE MODEL FOR ALL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF COMPANIES REPORTING USING INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS AND U.S. GAAP. THE STANDARD CONTAINS PRINCIPLES THAT AN ENTITY MUST APPLY TO DETERMINE THE MEASUREMENT OF REVENUE AND TIMING OF WHEN IT IS RECOGNIZED. THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE IS THAT AN ENTITY MUST RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AT AN AMOUNT THAT THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. AN ENTITY CAN APPLY THE REVENUE STANDARD RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PRIOR REPORTING PERIOD PRESENTED (FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD) OR RETROSPECTIVELY WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING THE STANDARD RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION IN RETAINED EARNINGS (MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD).  THE STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JULY 1, 2018. THE COMPANY ELECTED TO ADOPT THE STANDARD USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THIS APPROACH WAS ADOPTED BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE NEW STANDARD HAS VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR THE CURRENT PRODUCTS SOLD.  THE COMPANY GENERATES REVENUE BY SELLING HUMAN CELL AND TISSUE PRODUCTS (HC/TP\\u2019S) TO CLINICS AND DOCTORS. REVENUE FROM THESE SALES ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT NET OF ANY DISCOUNTS OR CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCES. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT INDICATES TRANSFER OF CONTROL FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES.  WE HAVE EVALUATED EACH OF THE FIVE STEPS IN TOPIC 606, WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS.  1) IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER;  2) IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT;  3) DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE;  4) ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS; AND  5) RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN (OR AS) PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED.  OUR CONCLUSION IS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SIMILAR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER ASC TOPIC 606 AS COMPARED WITH DELIVERABLES AND SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNT PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED UNDER THE OLD STANDARD. AS A RESULT, THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUE APPEARS TO REMAIN THE SAME IN COMPARISON TO THE PRIOR REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE.  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH A DIRECT SALES FORCE AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTION IN THE U.S.  REVENUES FROM THESE CUSTOMERS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN ALL THE FIVE STEPS IDENTIFIED ABOVE HAVE OCCURRED.  THESE CRITERIA ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT WHEN RISK OF LOSS AND TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER.  WE RESERVE FOR SALES RETURNS, INCLUDING RETURNS RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, AS A REDUCTION IN NET SALES, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.  THESE RESERVES ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN NET SALES AND ARE NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR 6 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE WITH HISTORICAL DISCOUNT PATTERNS AND USES THIS EXPERIENCE TO FINALIZE TRANSACTION PRICES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASU 2016-12, THE COMPANY WOULD ELECT TO EXCLUDE FROM THE MEASUREMENT OF TRANSACTION PRICE, ALL TAXES ASSESSED BY A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY THAT ARE BOTH IMPOSED ON AND CONCURRENT WITH A SPECIFIC REVENUE-PRODUCING TRANSACTION AND COLLECTED BY THE COMPANY FROM A CUSTOMER FOR E.G. SALES TAX, VALUE ADDED TAX ETC.  HOWEVER, AS OUR BUSINESS IS THUS FAR NOT WITH THE END CONSUMER, THE COLLECTION OF TAXES IS UNNECESSARY.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ELECTED TO APPLY THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT FOR NOT ADJUSTING REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY. THIS PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT HAS BEEN ELECTED BECAUSE THE COMPANY COLLECTS CASH DIRECTLY FROM CUSTOMERS IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO SHIPMENT.  THERE ARE ALSO CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING TOPIC 606. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING OUR CONTROL FRAMEWORK FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION AND IDENTIFYING ANY CHANGES THAT MAY NEED TO BE MADE IN RESPONSE TO THE NEW GUIDANCE. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE IN TOPIC 606 HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED IN COMPARISON TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CURRENT GUIDANCE.  SHIPPING AND HANDLING  WE BILL OUR CUSTOMERS FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING CHARGES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN NET SALES FOR THE APPLICABLE PERIOD, AND THE CORRESPONDING SHIPPING AND HANDLING EXPENSE IS REPORTED IN COST OF SALES.  26  RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS  WE EXPENSE RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS INCURRED.  PRODUCT LIABILITY AND WARRANTY COSTS  WE MAINTAIN PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE AND HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY RELATED CLAIMS FROM ITS PRODUCTS OFFERINGS. WE ALSO OFFER A WARRANTY TO CUSTOMERS PROVIDING THAT ITS PRODUCTS WILL BE DELIVERED FREE OF ANY MATERIALS DEFECTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL COSTS INCURRED SINCE INCEPTION BASED ON ESTIMATED RETURN RATES.  WE REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED ACCRUAL ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  INCOME TAXES  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED TO REFLECT THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. DEFERRED TAXES ARE CALCULATED BY APPLYING ENACTED STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX LAWS TO FUTURE YEARS IN WHICH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. THE IMPACT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A CHANGE IN TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT THE RATE CHANGE IS ENACTED.  MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE  THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE RECEIVED UPON THE SALE OF AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MARKED TO BID PRICES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE MARKED TO OFFER PRICES. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS. A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS USED TO PRIORITIZE THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE INFORMATION USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES.  CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS DEFINED IN THE FOLLOWING THREE CATEGORIES.  LEVEL 1: QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL 2: OBSERVABLE MARKET-BASED INPUTS OR INPUTS THAT ARE CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.  LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF SALES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS.  KEY ESTIMATES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURNS, PROVISIONS FOR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  (\\u201cASU 2016-02\\u201d), WHICH MODIFIED LEASE ACCOUNTING FOR BOTH LESSEES AND LESSORS TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES BY LESSEES FOR THOSE LEASES CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND DISCLOSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. ASU 2016-02 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JULY 1, 2019 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE TIMING OF ITS ADOPTION AND THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE NEW LEASE STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2017-01,  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (TOPIC 805): CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS  , WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO ENTITIES TO ASSIST WITH EVALUATING WHEN A SET OF TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES IS A BUSINESS AND PROVIDES A SCREEN TO DETERMINE WHEN A SET IS NOT A BUSINESS. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WHEN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE FAIR VALUE OF GROSS ASSETS ACQUIRED (OR DISPOSED OF) IS CONCENTRATED IN A SINGLE IDENTIFIABLE ASSET, OR GROUP OF SIMILAR ASSETS, THE ASSETS ACQUIRED WOULD NOT REPRESENT A BUSINESS. ALSO, TO BE CONSIDERED A BUSINESS, AN ACQUISITION WOULD HAVE TO INCLUDE AN INPUT AND A SUBSTANTIVE PROCESS THAT TOGETHER SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE OUTPUTS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, AND SHOULD BE APPLIED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS TO ANY TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING WITHIN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL PERIODS IN WHICH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ISSUED. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-01 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-16,  INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740): INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS OTHER THAN INVENTORY  , WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET, OTHER THAN INVENTORY, WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS. ASU 2016-16 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASU 2016-16 ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-15,  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (TOPIC 230): CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS  , WHICH ADDRESSES EIGHT SPECIFIC CASH FLOW ISSUES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING THE EXISTING DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE IN HOW CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS ARE PRESENTED AND CLASSIFIED IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. ASU 2016-15 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018 WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JANUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-01,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - OVERALL: RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES,  WHICH AMENDS THE GUIDANCE REGARDING THE CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL  27  INSTRUMENTS. CHANGES TO THE CURRENT GUIDANCE PRIMARILY AFFECT THE ACCOUNTING FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS, FINANCIAL LIABILITIES UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, AND THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. IN ADDITION, ASU 2016-01 CLARIFIES GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ASSESSMENT WHEN RECOGNIZING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESULTING FROM UNREALIZED LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES. ASU 2016-01 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED EXCEPT FOR THE PROVISION TO RECORD FAIR VALUE CHANGES FOR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION RESULTING FROM INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01, AN ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE AMENDMENTS BY MEANS OF A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2015-17,  INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740): BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES  , WHICH WILL REQUIRE ALL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES TO BE PRESENTED AS NONCURRENT WITHIN A CLASSIFIED BALANCE SHEET. ASU 2015-17 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US AS OF JULY 1, 2017. ASU 2015-17 MAY BE APPLIED EITHER PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. WE HAVE ELECTED NOT TO EARLY ADOPT ASU 2015-17. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2015-17 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  , TO UPDATE THE FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. TOPIC 606 OUTLINES A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE MODEL FOR ENTITIES TO USE IN ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPERSEDES MOST CURRENT REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE. THE GUIDANCE IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. THE GUIDANCE ALSO  REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS AND ASSETS RECOGNIZED FROM COSTS INCURRED TO FULFILL A CONTRACT. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018, AND ENTITIES HAVE THE OPTION OF USING EITHER A FULL RETROSPECTIVE OR A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD. WE HAVE EVALUATED THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS AND BELIEVE IT WILL HAVE NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THIS STANDARD ON A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE BASIS.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  PREDICTIVE THERAPEUTICS, LLC  ON APRIL 15, 2015, GLOBAL ENTERPRISES GROUP, INC. (\\u201cGLHO\\u201d) ACQUIRED 100% OF PREDICTIVE THERAPEUTICS, LLC.  AFTER THE ACQUISITION, GLHO CHANGED ITS NAME TO PREDICTIVE TECHNOLOGY GROUP, INC.   ON OCTOBER 31, 2015, THE INITIAL AGREEMENT WAS MODIFIED TO MAKE CERTAIN TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR CONTINGENCIES WHICH WERE NOT MET AT THAT DATE.  THE COMPANY ISSUED A TOTAL OF 131,058,458 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN THIS TRANSACTION.  UNDER THIS MERGER AGREEMENT, THERE WAS A CHANGE IN CONTROL WHICH HAS BEEN TREATED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AS A REVERSE RECAPITALIZATION.  LIFECODE GENETICS, INC.,  ON NOVEMBER 6, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE ACQUISITION OF LIFECODE GENETICS, INC. (\\u201cLIFECODE\\u201d) AS ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY. LIFECODE HOLDS A STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENT OF 10.169% IN JUNEAU BIOSCIENCES, LLC (\\u201cJUNEAU\\u201d).   IN ADDITION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ASSAY AND RELATED SERVICES FOR THE PROGNOSIS AND MONITORING OF ENDOMETRIOSIS IN THE INFERTILITY MARKET WHICH THE COMPANY HAS LICENSED, JUNEAU IS DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF OTHER WOMEN\\u2019S HEALTH ISSUES.  THE COMPANY ISSUED 6,561,870 COMMON SHARES TO ACQUIRE LIFECODE AND HAS RECORDED THE ACQUISITION AS A PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT WITH A VALUATION SET AT $16,404,675.  A SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT WAS ENTERED INTO ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 THAT REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO ISSUE TO LIFECODE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT AN ADDITIONAL 5,718,372 SHARES.  USING THE OTC VALUE (DEFINED AS THE SHARE PRICE LISTED ON THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER DEALER MARKETS AND NETWORKS) FOR THE ADDITIONAL SHARES ISSUED RESULTS IN AN INCREASE OF VALUE TO $30,700,605, AN INCREASE OF $14,295,930.  A VALUATION PERFORMED BY AN EXTERNAL OUTSIDE VALUATION EXPERT SUPPORTS A SEPTEMBER 22, 2015 VALUE OF $16,520,150 RESULTING IN A DAY ONE IMPAIRMENT OF $14,180,455.  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PURCHASE CONSIDERATION ISSUED TO THE SELLERS OF LIFECODE WAS ALLOCATED TO THE UNITS OF EQUITY ACQUIRED.  JUNEAU REPORTS TO ITS MEMBERS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS AND LIFECODE RECORDS ITS DISTRIBUTABLE SHARE OF SUCH REPORTED INCOME USING THE EQUITY METHOD.  SEC RULE 4-08(G) OF REGULATION S-X REQUIRES A REGISTRANT TO DISCLOSE, IN THE NOTES TO ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SUMMARIZED BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT INFORMATION OF ALL INVESTEES ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS, IF DEEMED SIGNIFICANT.

FISCAL 2017  REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS (NET) FOR FISCAL 2018 TOTALED $16,624,336 COMPARED TO $2,585,362 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASE OF $14,038,974 IS A RESULT OF AN EXPANSION OF OUR SALES FORCE AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS LEADING TO INCREASED SALES OF OUR HCT/PS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD (\\u201cCOGS\\u201d) INCLUDES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING, MANUFACTURE (INCLUDING MATERIAL AND DIRECT LABOR), PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION, SHIPPING, AND OTHER DIRECT EXPENSES RELATING TO OUR HCT/PS. OUR GROSS PROFIT DURING 2018 WAS $12,653,081 COMPARED TO $1,834,057 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASED GROSS PROFIT RESULTED FROM INCREASED SALES AND EFFICIENCIES INTRODUCED INTO OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES WERE $12,680,741 FOR FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO $1,897,543 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASED SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES RESULTED FROM CORRESPONDING INCREASES IN SALES, AS WELL AS $7.5M IN WARRANTS ISSUED TO SALES MANAGEMENT AS THEY MET PREDETERMINED MILESTONES BASED ON REVENUE GROWTH.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $1,896,092 FOR FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO $84,729 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES RESULTED FROM INCREASED FOCUS ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, STREAMLINING MANUFACTURING METHODS AND ADDITIONAL PROPRIETARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WORK PRIMARILY RELATING TO OUR HCT/PS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2018 WERE $5,827,891 COMPARED TO $946,754 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RESULTED FROM INCREASED MANAGEMENT HEADCOUNT AND WARRANTS ISSUED FOR CONSULTING RELATING TO ALL BUSINESS ENTITIES.  32  AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2018 WERE $4,573,534 COMPARED TO $3,693,579 FOR FISCAL 2017. THE REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE EXPENSE OF COSTS RELATING TO OUR ACQUISITIONS  ON AUGUST 1, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE CONVERTIBLE, UNSECURED NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM JUNEAU FROM EXISTING NOTEHOLDERS IN EXCHANGE FOR STOCK OF THE COMPANY. THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS OWED ON SAID NOTES RECEIVABLE IS SUBJECT TO A SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY CREDITOR OF JUNEAU THAT IS OWED THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $700,000 PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST ON AN OBLIGATION THAT COMES DUE JULY 31, 2018. IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS EVENT, ON JUNE 15, 2017, AN AMENDMENT WAS ALSO MADE TO THE RESTATED AGREEMENT TO SUBORDINATE THE DEBT JUNEAU OWES TO PTG. THE FACE AMOUNT OF THE NOTES ACQUIRED WAS $2,870,380 AND 5,740,760 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED. THE NOTES BEAR INTEREST PAYABLE IN JUNEAU UNITS AT 12% AND ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO CLASS A UNITS OF JUNEAU AT THE RATE OF $1.00 PER UNIT. PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST ARE DUE IN A SINGLE INSTALLMENT ON AUGUST 1, 2018. UPON FURTHER REVIEW USING THE OTC VALUE AT THE DATE OF CLOSURE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A PRICE PER SHARE OF .78 CENTS WAS APPROXIMATE MARKET VALUE.  THEREFORE, THE VALUE OF THE SHARES GIVEN SHOULD BE $4,473,774, AN INCREASE OF $1,603,394. THIS DISCOUNT AT THE DATE OF THE SHARE TRANSFERS IS THEN CONSIDERED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE NOTES. THERE WAS NO CORRESPONDING IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN FISCAL 2018.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\\\" AND THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\\\"GAAP\\\").  THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS AFFECTING THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TOTAL COSTS ON LONG-TERM  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSTRUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS, COSTS TO BE INCURRED FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND EXTENDED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BAD DEBTS, EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, INCOME TAXES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND CONTINGENCIES.  OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  OVERVIEW  WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A WIDE RANGE OF DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  WE FOCUS OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS ON MARKETS, GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AND PRODUCTS.  OUR FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONSIST OF FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS AND THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  THE FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL, LIVE EVENTS, HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION, AND TRANSPORTATION, ALL OF WHICH INCLUDE THE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  DISCLOSURES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED IN \\\"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \\\" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  OUR NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY HISTORICALLY HAVE FLUCTUATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, SUCH AS DISPLAY SYSTEMS FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FACILITIES, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND SPECTACULAR PROJECTS IN THE COMMERCIAL AREA, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY OF THE SPORTS MARKET.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS CAN INCLUDE SEVERAL DISPLAYS, CONTROLLERS, AND SUBCONTRACTED STRUCTURE BUILDS, EACH OF WHICH CAN OCCUR ON VARIED SCHEDULES PER THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS.  OUTDOOR INSTALLATION SALES CAN BE IMPACTED BY OUTDOOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON.  OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER TENDS TO BE A SLOWER QUARTER BECAUSE IT INCLUDES TWO HOLIDAYS, IT IS AFFECTED BY SPORTS SEASONALITY, AND GENERALLY LESS OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION WORK OCCURS DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS.  OUR GROSS MARGINS TEND TO FLUCTUATE MORE ON UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS THAN ON LIMITED CONFIGURED ORDERS.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS INVOLVING COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND SUBSTANTIAL SUBCONTRACT WORK FOR PRODUCT INSTALLATION GENERALLY HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  ALTHOUGH WE FOLLOW THE OVER TIME METHOD OF RECOGNIZING REVENUES FOR UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, WE NEVERTHELESS HAVE EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS AND EXPECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FLUCTUATIONS.  OUR REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (\\\"BACKLOG\\\") CONSIST OF CONTRACTUALLY BINDING SALES AGREEMENTS OR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC DISPLAY SYSTEMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND EXCLUDE EXTENDED SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND SERVICE ONLY ORDERS.  ORDERS ARE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG WHEN WE ARE IN RECEIPT OF AN EXECUTED CONTRACT AND ANY REQUIRED DEPOSITS OR SECURITY.  AS A RESULT, CERTAIN ORDERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR CONTRACTS WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG UNTIL ALL REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS AND DEPOSITS ARE RECEIVED.  BACKLOG CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO LARGE ORDER BOOKINGS AND THE TIMING AND SEASONALITY OF NET SALES.  BECAUSE ORDER BACKLOG FLUCTUATES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXTENDED DELIVERY SCHEDULES, ORDERS MAY BE CANCELED AND HAVE VARIED ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY.  OUR BACKLOG IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE NET SALES OR NET INCOME.  GENERAL  OUR MISSION IS TO BE THE WORLD LEADER AT INFORMING AND ENTERTAINING AUDIENCES THROUGH DYNAMIC AUDIO-VISUAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.  WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS THROUGH ESTIMATED MARKET SHARE BASED ON ESTIMATED MARKET DEMAND FOR DIGITAL DISPLAYS AND GENERATING PROFITS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  OUR SUCCESS IS CONTINGENT ON THE DEPTH AND QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING RELATED CONTROL SYSTEMS, THE DEPTH OF OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS AND OUR TECHNOLOGY SERVING THESE MARKET DEMANDS.  THESE QUALITIES ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS BECAUSE OUR PRODUCTS HAVE FINITE LIFETIMES, AND WE STRIVE TO WIN REPLACEMENT BUSINESS FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS.  INCREASES IN USER ADOPTION, THE ACCEPTANCE OF A VARIETY OF DIGITAL SOLUTIONS, AND THE DECLINE OF DIGITAL SOLUTION PRICING OVER THE YEARS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE GLOBAL MARKET.  WITH THIS POSITIVE DEMAND, STRONG COMPETITION EXISTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, WHICH CAUSES MARGIN CONSTRAINTS.  PROJECTS WITH MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR REVENUE POTENTIAL ALSO ATTRACT COMPETITION, WHICH GENERALLY REDUCES PROFITABILITY.  WE ORGANIZE AROUND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN \\\"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \\\" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT ALSO HAS UNIQUE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS AND CHALLENGES.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \\u2022  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCT MARKET GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH DRIVE MARKETPLACE EXPANSION.  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCTS ARE USED TO ATTRACT OR COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF RETAIL, COMMERCIAL, AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS.  PRICING AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR SUCCESS IN THIS BUSINESS UNIT.  WE UTILIZE A RESELLER NETWORK TO DISTRIBUTE OUR STANDARD PRODUCTS.  \\u2022  NATIONAL ACCOUNTS STANDARD DISPLAY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CUSTOMERS' DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR MESSAGE, ADVERTISING AND CONTENT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  INCREASED DEMAND IS POSSIBLE FROM RETAILERS, QUICK SERVE RESTAURANTS, PETROLEUM BUSINESSES, AND OTHER NATIONWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.  \\u2022  INCREASING INTEREST IN SPECTACULARS, WHICH INCLUDE VERY LARGE AND SOMETIMES HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED DISPLAYS AS PART OF ENTERTAINMENT VENUES SUCH AS CASINOS, SHOPPING CENTERS, CRUISE SHIPS AND TIMES SQUARE TYPE LOCATIONS.  \\u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS DEMAND GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND MARKETPLACE EXPANSION.  \\u2022  THE USE OF ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, WHICH REAL ESTATE OWNERS USE TO ADD ACCENTS OR EFFECTS TO AN ENTIRE SIDE OR CIRCUMFERENCE OF A BUILDING TO COMMUNICATE MESSAGES OR TO DECORATE THE BUILDING.  \\u2022  THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF DIGITAL BILLBOARDS AS OUT-OF-HOME (\\\"OOH\\\") ADVERTISING COMPANIES CONTINUE DEVELOPING NEW SITES AND REPLACING DIGITAL BILLBOARDS REACHING END OF LIFE.  THIS IS DEPENDENT ON NO ADVERSE CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE DIGITAL BILLBOARD REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RESTRICTING FUTURE BILLBOARD DEPLOYMENT, AS WELL AS MAINTAINING OUR CURRENT MARKET SHARE IN A BUSINESS THAT IS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW LARGE OOH COMPANIES.  \\u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \\u2022  FACILITIES SPENDING MORE ON LARGER DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE THE GAME-DAY AND EVENT EXPERIENCE FOR ATTENDEES.  \\u2022  LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, DRIVING AN EXPANSION OF THE MARKETPLACE.  \\u2022  OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, WHICH REMAIN THE MOST INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE OFFERINGS IN THE INDUSTRY.  \\u2022  THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF SPORTS TEAMS, WHICH STRIVE TO OUT-PERFORM THEIR COMPETITORS WITH DISPLAY SYSTEMS.  \\u2022  THE DESIRE FOR HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO DISPLAYS, WHICH TYPICALLY DRIVES LARGER DISPLAYS OR HIGHER RESOLUTION DISPLAYS, BOTH OF WHICH INCREASE THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION SIZE.  \\u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS NEEDS THROUGHOUT A SPORTS FACILITY.  \\u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \\u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR VIDEO SYSTEMS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALIZE THE REVENUE GENERATING POTENTIAL OF THESE DISPLAYS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL SCOREBOARDS.  \\u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISPLAYS AND DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MESSAGE CENTERS AT SCHOOLS TO COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS, PARENTS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY.  \\u2022  THE USE OF MORE SOPHISTICATED DISPLAYS IN SCHOOL ATHLETIC FACILITIES, SUCH AS LARGE INTEGRATED VIDEO SYSTEMS.  TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM INCREASING APPLICATIONS AND ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS TO MANAGE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ROADWAY, AIRPORT, PARKING, TRANSIT AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.  EFFECTIVE USE OF THE UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  THIS GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING, PRIMARILY BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, ALONG WITH THE CONTINUING ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE.  GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS FOR ADVERTISING AND WAY-FINDING USE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND AIRPORT TERMINALS.  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM ACHIEVING GREATER PENETRATION IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES AND BUILDING PRODUCTS MORE SUITED TO INDIVIDUAL MARKETS.  WE CONTINUE TO BROADEN OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE ALSO FOCUS ON SPORTS FACILITY, SPECTACULAR-TYPE, AND THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND THE FACTORS LISTED IN EACH OF THE OTHER BUSINESS UNITS TO THE EXTENT THEY APPLY OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS IS IMPACTED BY ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES.  THE EFFECTS OF AN ADVERSE ECONOMY ARE GENERALLY LESS SEVERE ON OUR SPORTS RELATED BUSINESS AS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, ALTHOUGH IN SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, THE SPORTS BUSINESS ALSO CAN BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED.  OUR COMMERCIAL AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNITS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN GENERAL.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COST TO MANUFACTURE AND THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE DECREASED OVER TIME AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN THE FUTURE.  AS A RESULT, EACH YEAR WE MUST SELL MORE PRODUCT TO GENERATE THE SAME OR GREATER LEVEL OF NET SALES AS IN PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS.  THIS PRICE DECLINE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT AS A RESULT OF INCREASED COMPETITION ACROSS ALL BUSINESS UNITS.  OUR ANNUAL REPORT DISCLOSES RISK FACTORS WE FACE, INCLUDING EXPOSURE TO GEOPOLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL CHANGES.  FOR FISCAL YEAR  2019  , WHILE WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT LONG-TERM GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL DISPLAY INDUSTRY, THE RECENT U.S. ADMINISTRATIVE TRADE ACTIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND SANCTIONS, AND RELATED REACTIONS AND RESPONSES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE VERY DYNAMIC.  THIS ENVIRONMENT HAS CREATED VOLATILITY, SUCH AS INCREASES IN PRICING OF AND DEMAND FOR ALUMINUM, ELECTRICAL, AND OTHER COMPONENTS WE USE IN OUR PRODUCTION.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND EVALUATE WAYS TO MINIMIZE THESE IMPACTS THROUGH VENDOR NEGOTIATIONS, ALTERNATIVE SOURCES, AND POTENTIAL PRICE ADJUSTMENTS.  WE ALSO EXPECT SOME OF THE MEASURES BEING CONTEMPLATED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENTS WILL CREATE MARKET REACTIONS AND WILL POSSIBLY HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT IN FUTURE QUARTERS.

WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FINANCED WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE USED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH BALANCES TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

AT  JANUARY 26, 2019  , WE HAD  $6.6 MILLION  OF BONDED WORK OUTSTANDING AGAINST THIS LINE.  OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES DEPEND ON INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: (I) CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY THE PER TON PRICE FOR CRUSHED CAR BODIES, AS WE BELIEVE THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES SOLD FOR SCRAP AND VEHICLES SOLD FOR DISMANTLING; (II) USED CAR PRICING, WHICH WE ALSO BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (III) THE MIX OF CARS SOLD; AND (IV) CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON AUCTION PARTICIPATION BY INTERNATIONAL BUYERS. WE CANNOT SPECIFICALLY QUANTIFY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT COMMODITY PRICING, USED CAR PRICING, AND PRODUCT SALES MIX HAS ON THE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES, OUR SERVICE REVENUES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPAIRS COSTS, USED CAR VALUES, AND AUCTION RETURNS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN OVERALL GROWTH IN THE SALVAGE MARKET DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN USED CAR VALUES RELATIVE TO REPAIR COSTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE GENERALLY TRENDING UPWARD. CONVERSELY, INCREASES IN USED CAR PRICES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING THE MOST RECENT RECESSION, MAY DECREASE TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH RATE. USED CAR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING USED CAR SUPPLY, WHICH IS TIED DIRECTLY TO NEW CAR SALES, AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD CONTINUED TO INCREASE, GROWING FROM 9.6 YEARS IN 2002 TO 12.1 YEARS IN 2018. THE FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR PRICING, AND AUCTION RETURNS ARE MANY AND VARIED AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THEIR MOVEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE TRENDS IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES.  YARD OPERATIONS EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OPERATING PERSONNEL (WHICH INCLUDES YARD MANAGEMENT, CLERICAL AND YARD EMPLOYEES), RENT, CONTRACT VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FUEL, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, AND COSTS OF VEHICLES SOLD UNDER THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING, SALES PERSONNEL, HUMAN RESOURCES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY INCLUDES INCOME FROM THE RENTAL OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, WHICH WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THESE ACTIVITIES EACH PERIOD. OTHER EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \\u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT.  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL IS CASH OPERATING RESULTS AND DEBT FINANCING. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING CASH OPERATING RESULTS ARE: (I) SEASONALITY; (II) MARKET WINS AND LOSSES; (III) SUPPLIER MIX; (IV) ACCIDENT FREQUENCY; (V) TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (VI) INCREASED VOLUME FROM OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS; (VII) COMMODITY PRICING; (VIII) USED CAR PRICING; (IX) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; (X) PRODUCT MIX; (XI) CONTRACT MIX TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; AND (XII) OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE FACTORS ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS SECTIONS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  POTENTIAL INTERNAL SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL ARE THE SALE OF ASSETS OR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES AND SHARES ISSUED UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. A POTENTIAL EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL IS THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT WITH NEW LENDERS AND EQUITY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT IF THESE SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE OR ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  24  ACQUISITIONS AND NEW OPERATIONS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL EXPANSION STRATEGY OF OFFERING INTEGRATED SERVICES TO VEHICLE SELLERS, WE ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING FACILITIES IN NEW REGIONS, AS WELL AS THE REGIONS CURRENTLY SERVED BY OUR FACILITIES.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WERE  20.4%  AND  28.5%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  21.8%  , AND  30.1%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTED OF BANK DEPOSITS, DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FUNDS INVESTED IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK, EQUITY ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT FINANCING. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS FROM THE COLLECTION OF SERVICE FEES AND REIMBURSABLE ADVANCES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF VEHICLE SALES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES FOR OUR REMAINING CASH BALANCES AND OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STOCK REPURCHASES, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND ACQUISITIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAIL, SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \\u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND  NOTE  8 \\u2013 STOCK REPURCHASES  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \\u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \\u201d AND \\u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \\u201d BELOW.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AS INCLEMENT WEATHER DURING THE WINTER MONTHS INCREASES THE FREQUENCY OF ACCIDENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, MOST OF OUR FACILITIES PROCESS 10% TO 30% MORE VEHICLES THAN AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR. THIS INCREASED VOLUME REQUIRES THE INCREASED USE OF OUR CASH TO PAY OUT ADVANCES AND HANDLING COSTS OF THE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS AND EXPAND SOME OF OUR CURRENT FACILITIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CASH THROUGH DRAWDOWNS ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO FUND THIS EXPANSION. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF GROWTH THROUGH EXPANSION AND ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE, THE OPENING OF NEW GREENFIELD YARDS IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE PROPERTY THAT (I) IS IN AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE A NEED FOR MORE CAPACITY; (II) HAS ADEQUATE SIZE GIVEN THE CAPACITY NEEDS; (III) HAS THE APPROPRIATE SHAPE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR OUR OPERATIONS; (IV) IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO A MAJOR ROAD OR HIGHWAY; AND (V) MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING FOR OUR BUSINESS. COSTS TO DEVELOP A NEW YARD CAN RANGE FROM $3.0 TO $50.0 MILLION, DEPENDING ON SIZE, LOCATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  ,  $69.4 MILLION  OF THE  $108.2 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., THE REPATRIATION OF THESE FUNDS COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX FOLLOWING THE U.S. TAX REFORM. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT REQUIRE REPATRIATION TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  9 \\u2013 INCOME TAXES  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING U.S. TAX REFORM AND ITS CORRESPONDING IMPACT ON FOREIGN CASH REPATRIATION.  NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO IMPROVED CASH OPERATING RESULTS FROM AN INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES AND VEHICLE SALES AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $31.6 MILLION DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, A DECREASE IN INVENTORY AND VEHICLE POOLING COSTS OF $22.8 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE OF $12.7 MILLION RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  30  NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEASE BUYOUTS OF CERTAIN FACILITIES, ACQUIRING LAND, OPENING AND IMPROVING FACILITIES, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR NEW SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE AND MAJOR SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS, AND ACQUIRING YARD EQUIPMENT. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, EXPAND AND INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES AND STANDARDIZE THE APPEARANCE OF EXISTING LOCATIONS.  NET CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AS PART OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL UNDER THE SUBHEADING \\\"  STOCK REPURCHASES  \\\" AND A DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET PROCEEDS FROM OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \\u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \\u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \\u201d, AND \\u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \\u201d.  CREDIT AGREEMENT  ON  DECEMBER 3, 2014  , WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, THE \\u201cCREDIT AMENDMENT\\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS SYNDICATION AGENT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR (A) A SECURED REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO  $300.0 MILLION  (THE \\u201cREVOLVING LOAN FACILITY\\u201d), AND (B) A SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $300.0 MILLION  (THE \\u201cTERM LOAN\\u201d), WHICH WAS FULLY DRAWN AT CLOSING. THE TERM LOAN AMORTIZED  $18.8 MILLION  PER QUARTER.  ON  MARCH 15, 2016  , WE ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cAMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDED CERTAIN TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF  DECEMBER 3, 2014  . THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR (A) AN INCREASE IN THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS BY  $50.0 MILLION  , BRINGING THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO  $350.0 MILLION  , (B) A NEW SECURED TERM LOAN (THE \\u201cINCREMENTAL TERM LOAN\\u201d) IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $93.8 MILLION  HAVING A MATURITY DATE OF  MARCH 15, 2021  , AND (C) AN EXTENSION OF THE TERMINATION DATE OF THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN FROM  DECEMBER 3, 2019  TO  MARCH 15, 2021  . THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT EXTENDED THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR THE TERM LOAN AND DECREASED THE QUARTERLY AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS FOR THAT LOAN TO  $7.5 MILLION  PER QUARTER. THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT ADDITIONALLY REDUCED THE PRICING LEVELS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO A RANGE OF  0.15%  TO  0.30%  IN THE CASE OF THE COMMITMENT FEE,  1.125%  TO  2.0%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, AND  0.125%  TO  1.0%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS, BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER. WE BORROWED THE ENTIRE  $93.8 MILLION  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN CONCURRENT WITH THE CLOSING OF THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT.  ON  JULY 21, 2016  , WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cSECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, SUNTRUST BANK, AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (AS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST TO WELLS FARGO BANK). THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDS CERTAIN TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 3, 2014 AS AMENDED BY THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF  MARCH 15, 2016  .

CONCURRENT WITH THE CLOSING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE PREPAID IN FULL THE OUTSTANDING  $242.5 MILLION  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN AND INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITHOUT PREMIUM OR PENALTY. THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT REDUCED THE PRICING LEVELS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO A RANGE OF  0.125%  TO  0.20%  IN THE CASE OF THE COMMITMENT FEE,  1.00%  TO  1.75%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, AND  0.0%  TO  0.75%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS, IN EACH CASE DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO. THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSES OF THESE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WERE TO INCREASE THE SIZE AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING. THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, OR OTHER INVESTMENTS RELATING TO OUR EXPANSION STRATEGIES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BEARS INTEREST, AT OUR ELECTION, AT EITHER (A) THE BASE RATE, WHICH IS DEFINED AS A FLUCTUATING RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE GREATEST OF (I) THE PRIME RATE IN EFFECT ON SUCH DAY; (II) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN EFFECT ON SUCH DATE PLUS  0.50%  ; OR (III) AN ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF A ONE-MONTH INTEREST PERIOD PLUS  1.0%  , IN EACH CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM  0.0%  TO  0.75%  BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER; OR (B) AN ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM  1.00%  TO  1.75%  DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER. INTEREST IS DUE AND PAYABLE QUARTERLY, IN ARREARS, FOR LOANS BEARING INTEREST AT THE BASE RATE, AND AT THE END OF AN INTEREST PERIOD (OR AT EACH THREE MONTH INTERVAL IN THE CASE OF LOANS WITH INTEREST PERIODS GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS) IN THE CASE OF LOANS BEARING INTEREST AT THE ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE. THE INTEREST RATE AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY WAS THE ONE MONTH  LIBOR RATE OF 2.50% PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 1.00%.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS COMPRISED OF BORROWINGS UNDER WHICH INTEREST ACCRUES UNDER A FLUCTUATING INTEREST RATE STRUCTURE. ACCORDINGLY, THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AND WAS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL II OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.  31  AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY  MAY BE REPAID AND REBORROWED UNTIL THE MATURITY DATE OF  JULY 21, 2021  . WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY A COMMITMENT FEE ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.
