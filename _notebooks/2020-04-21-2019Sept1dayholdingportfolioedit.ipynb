CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH ITS PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO CASH FLOWS FROM THIS SOURCE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A RELATIVELY STABLE INDUSTRY AND HAS STRONG BRANDS ACROSS MANY PRODUCT LINES.  THE COMPANY IS DEDICATED TO RETURNING EXCESS CASH FLOW TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  GROWING THE BUSINESS THROUGH INNOVATION AND EVALUATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS REMAINS A FOCUS FOR THE COMPANY.

SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE SET FORTH HEREIN; OPERATIONS DISRUPTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION; OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN QUALIFIED SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND SERVICE TECHNICIANS WHO RELATE DIRECTLY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS; THE REDUCTION, MODIFICATION, CANCELLATION OR DELAY OF PURCHASES OF INNOVATIVE, HIGH-MARGIN EQUIPMENT; MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR PURCHASING RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS; CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND THE OTHER RISKS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS CONTAINED AND IDENTIFIED IN PATTERSON\\u2019S PREVIOUS FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, SUCH AS ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, ANY OF WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  IS SUMMARIZED IN THIS MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE FOLLOWING BACKGROUND IS PROVIDED TO READERS TO ASSIST IN THE REVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  WE PRESENT THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: DENTAL, ANIMAL HEALTH AND CORPORATE. DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH ARE STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNITS THAT OFFER SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO DIFFERENT CUSTOMER BASES. DENTAL PROVIDES A VIRTUALLY COMPLETE RANGE OF CONSUMABLE DENTAL PRODUCTS, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE, TURNKEY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS AND VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO DENTISTS AND DENTAL LABORATORIES THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA. ANIMAL HEALTH IS A LEADING, FULL-LINE DISTRIBUTOR IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE U.K. OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BOTH THE PRODUCTION-ANIMAL AND COMPANION-PET MARKETS. OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING HOME OFFICE SUPPORT COSTS IN AREAS SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, FINANCE, LEGAL, HUMAN RESOURCES AND FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMER FINANCING AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SALES ARE REPORTED WITHIN CORPORATE RESULTS.  OPERATING MARGINS OF THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE DENTAL BUSINESS. WHILE OPERATING EXPENSES RUN AT A LOWER RATE IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS WHEN COMPARED TO THE DENTAL BUSINESS, GROSS MARGINS IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER DUE GENERALLY TO THE LOW MARGINS EXPERIENCED ON THE SALE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.  WE OPERATE WITH A 52-53 WEEK ACCOUNTING CONVENTION WITH OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL. THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019 REPRESENTS THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  AND THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FISCAL 2020 WILL INCLUDE 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED 52 WEEKS.  WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS THAT ARE USEFUL IN ANALYZING IT, INCLUDING: (1) GROWTH IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE; (2) INTERNAL GROWTH; (3) GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITION; AND (4) CONTINUED FOCUS ON CONTROLLING COSTS AND ENHANCING EFFICIENCY. MANAGEMENT DEFINES INTERNAL GROWTH AS THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN THE NUMBER OF WEEKS IN FISCAL YEARS, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND EXCLUDING THE NET SALES, FOR A PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION DATE, OF BUSINESSES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION PROGRAM.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH MUFG BANK, LTD. (\\\"MUFG\\\"). UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, MUFG ACTS AS AN AGENT TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN PATTERSON RECEIVABLES (THE \\u201cRECEIVABLES\\u201d) TO CERTAIN UNAFFILIATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (THE \\u201cPURCHASERS\\u201d).  THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE RECEIVABLES COMPRISE A COMBINATION OF CASH AND A DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE (\\u201cDPP\\u201d) RECEIVABLE. THE INITIAL TRANSACTION WAS A SALE OF $237.6 MILLION OF NET RECEIVABLES.  FROM THIS SALE, WE RECEIVED $171.0 MILLION OF CASH AND A DPP RECEIVABLE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $65.9 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED A LOSS OF $0.7 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE INITIAL SALE WERE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE DEBT.  THE DPP RECEIVABLE IS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY PATTERSON FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES SOLD TO THE PURCHASERS. THE COLLECTION OF THE DPP RECEIVABLE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN INCREASE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  GAIN ON INVESTMENT  . WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $34.3 MILLION RELATED TO ONE OF OUR INVESTMENTS (\\\"GAIN ON INVESTMENT\\\") DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THIS GAIN WAS BASED ON THE SELLING PRICE OF PREFERRED STOCK IN THIS INVESTMENT THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE PREFERRED STOCK WE OWN, AND WAS ADJUSTED FOR DIFFERENCES IN LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES.  FISCAL 2020 LEGAL RESERVE  . WE INCURRED EXPENSES OF $17.7 MILLION (\\\" FISCAL 2020 LEGAL RESERVE\\\") DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF  LITIGATION WITH SOURCEONE DENTAL, INC.  SEE \\\"ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\\" FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  FISCAL 2019 LEGAL RESERVE  . IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LITIGATION ENTITLED  IN RE DENTAL SUPPLIES ANTITRUST LITIGATION  . UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT, WE PAID $28.3 MILLION INTO ESCROW UPON PRELIMINARY COURT APPROVAL.  SUCH FUNDS ARE TO BE RELEASED TO THE SETTLEMENT FUND ADMINISTRATOR UPON FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT, WHICH WAS GRANTED AT THE FAIRNESS HEARING HELD ON JUNE 24, 2019. WE ESTABLISHED A PRE-TAX RESERVE OF $28.3 MILLION (\\\"FISCAL 2019 LEGAL RESERVE\\\") DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER. SEE \\\"ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\\" FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  QUARTER ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR RESULTS AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES.

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE  $1,328.7 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  0.6%  FROM  $1,336.3 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF  0.7%  ON CURRENT QUARTER SALES. SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS WERE RECOGNIZED ON A NET BASIS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED 0.3% UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO SALES.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DENTAL SEGMENT SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE  $501.1 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  1.0%  FROM  $506.1 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  .

CURRENT QUARTER SALES OF CONSUMABLES DECREASED  0.7%  , SALES OF DENTAL EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE DECREASED  6.9%  , AND SALES OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES AND OTHER INCREASED  9.8%.  ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE  $817.5 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  0.9%  FROM  $825.2 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF  1.0%  ON CURRENT QUARTER SALES. SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS WERE RECOGNIZED ON A NET BASIS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED 0.4% UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO SALES.  GROSS PROFIT.  THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  INCREASED  60  BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER TO  21.8%  . GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATES INCREASED IN BOTH THE DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , AND HIGHER NET SALES IN OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT RELATED TO CUSTOMER FINANCING CONTRACTS POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE  $273.4 MILLION  , A  2.1%  DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER OF  $279.1 MILLION  . WE INCURRED HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FISCAL 2019 LEGAL RESERVE BEING APPROXIMATELY $10.6 MILLION GREATER THAN THE FISCAL 2020 LEGAL RESERVE. THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSE RATIO OF  20.5%  DECREASED  40  BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WHICH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY THIS SAME FACTOR.  OPERATING INCOME.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , OPERATING INCOME WAS  $16.7 MILLION  , OR  1.3%  OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO  $4.5 MILLION  , OR  0.3%  OF NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER LEGAL RESERVE RECORDED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  , AS WELL AS HIGHER GROSS MARGINS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  . THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS DRIVEN BY THESE SAME FACTORS.  DENTAL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $34.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $1.9 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES.  ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $19.6 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , AN INCREASE OF  $0.6 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATES.  CORPORATE SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS WAS  $37.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF  $50.4 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . THE CHANGE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE HIGHER LEGAL RESERVE RECORDED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  , AS WELL AS HIGHER NET SALES RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING CONTRACTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  NET OTHER INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WAS  $23.2 MILLION  , COMPARED TO NET OTHER EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  OF  $10.0 MILLION  .

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WAS  $30.0 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $(4.5) MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  .

WE EXPECT TO USE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL  2020.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WAS  $36.2 MILLION  . USES OF CASH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF  $25.5 MILLION  FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND  $5.5 MILLION  FOR THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT.

IN FISCAL 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT (\\u201cAMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d), CONSISTING OF A $295.1 MILLION TERM LOAN AND A $750 MILLION REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT.  IN MARCH 2019, WE PERMANENTLY REDUCED THE CAPACITY UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT TO $500 MILLION. INTEREST ON BORROWINGS IS VARIABLE AND IS DETERMINED AS A BASE RATE PLUS A SPREAD. THIS SPREAD, AS WELL AS A COMMITMENT FEE ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE FACILITY, IS BASED ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES WILL MATURE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 2022. AS OF  JULY 27, 2019  , $81.6 MILLION OF THE UNSECURED TERM LOAN WAS OUTSTANDING AT AN INTEREST RATE OF 3.5%, AND NO AMOUNT WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT. AS OF APRIL 27, 2019, $87.1 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE UNSECURED TERM LOAN AT AN INTEREST RATE OF 3.7%, AND NO AMOUNT WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT.

OVERVIEW  OUR COMMUNITY COUNT DECREASED 6.1% SEQUENTIALLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, FROM 147 COMMUNITIES AT APRIL 30, 2019 TO 138 AT JULY 31, 2019, AND INCREASED 12.2% FROM 123 COMMUNITIES AT JULY 31, 2018. THE SEQUENTIAL DECREASE OCCURRED AS OUR SALES PACE WAS FASTER THAN EXPECTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AND AS A RESULT, WE SOLD OUT OF MORE COMMUNITIES THAN EXPECTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF LOTS CONTROLLED INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH IS THE SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER FOR WHICH WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A YEAR-OVER-YEAR QUARTERLY INCREASE. WE BELIEVE CONTINUED GROWTH IN LOTS CONTROLLED SHOULD LEAD TO FURTHER COMMUNITY COUNT GROWTH. HOWEVER, THERE IS TYPICALLY A SIGNIFICANT TIME LAG FROM WHEN WE FIRST CONTROL LOTS UNTIL THE TIME THAT WE OPEN A COMMUNITY FOR SALE. THIS TIMELINE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM A FEW MONTHS (IN A MARKET SUCH AS HOUSTON) TO THREE TO FIVE PLUS YEARS (IN A MARKET SUCH AS NEW JERSEY). WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND GIVEN THE MIX OF LAND THAT WE CONTROL AND THE LAND INVESTMENT WE ANTICIPATE, WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT OUR COMMUNITY COUNT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. ULTIMATELY, COMMUNITY COUNT GROWTH, ABSENT ADVERSE MARKET FACTORS, SHOULD LEAD TO DELIVERY AND REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.  OUR CASH POSITION DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 ALLOWED US TO SPEND $400.0 MILLION ON LAND PURCHASES AND LAND DEVELOPMENT DURING THE PERIOD, AND STILL HAVE TOTAL LIQUIDITY OF $225.1 MILLION, INCLUDING $83.6 MILLION OF HOMEBUILDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF JULY 31, 2019. WE CONTINUE TO SEE OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE LAND AT PRICES THAT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE IN LIGHT OF OUR CURRENT SALES PRICES, SALES PACE AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND PLAN TO CONTINUE ACTIVELY PURSUING SUCH LAND ACQUISITIONS. NEW LAND PURCHASES AT PRICING THAT WE BELIEVE WILL GENERATE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DRIVE GREATER OPERATING EFFICIENCIES ARE NEEDED TO RETURN TO SUSTAINED PROFITABILITY; HOWEVER, WE REMAIN CAUTIOUS AND ARE CAREFULLY EVALUATING MARKET CONDITIONS WHEN PURSUING NEW LAND ACQUISITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, AMONG OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS, WE ARE CAREFULLY MONITORING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CURRENT TRADE AND TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS AND THE RELATED MARKET VOLATILITY ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TARIFFS RECENTLY IMPOSED ON PRODUCTS FROM CHINA AND ELSEWHERE HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS TO DATE, FUTURE TARIFFS OR THE THREAT THEREOF MAY HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND ON OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 BUDGETS.  ADDITIONAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \\u25cf FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, SALE OF HOMES REVENUES INCREASED 5.6% AND DECREASED 4.2%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A RESULT OF A 3.8% INCREASE AND 4.3% DECREASE IN DELIVERIES, RESPECTIVELY. THE QUARTERLY INCREASE WAS THE FIRST YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN REVENUES AND DELIVERIES SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016.  \\u25cf GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED FROM 15.4% AND 14.6% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, TO 14.0% FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES, WAS FLAT AT 18.4% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018 AND DECREASED FROM 18.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO 17.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  \\u25cf SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS (INCLUDING CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES) INCREASED $4.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND $1.3 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE, SUCH COSTS INCREASED FROM 11.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO 12.1% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND INCREASED FROM 12.9% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO 13.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019.  \\u25cf ACTIVE SELLING COMMUNITIES INCREASED 12.2% OVER LAST YEAR\\u2019S THIRD QUARTER. NET CONTRACTS INCREASED 22.6% AND 8.9% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  \\u25cf NET CONTRACTS PER AVERAGE ACTIVE SELLING COMMUNITY INCREASED TO 11.0 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 10.0 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, AND INCREASED TO 29.4 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 27.9 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  \\u25cf CONTRACT BACKLOG INCREASED FROM 2,287 HOMES AT JULY 31, 2018 TO 2,555 HOMES AT JULY 31, 2019, WITH A DOLLAR VALUE OF $1.1 BILLION, REPRESENTING A 11.4% INCREASE IN DOLLAR VALUE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WHEN COMPARING SEQUENTIALLY FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED FROM 13.3% TO 14.0% PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INCENTIVES ON SPEC HOMES THAT WERE SOLD AND DELIVERED DURING THE QUARTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COST OF SALES INTEREST PER HOME. GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES, INCREASED FROM 16.9% TO 18.4% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASED INCENTIVES DURING THE QUARTER. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS (INCLUDING CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES) DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM $60.3 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO $58.5 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $1.6 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED EXPENSE OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE BASED MARKET STOCK UNITS AWARDS FOR WHICH THE PERFORMANCE METRICS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE SATISFIED. AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES, THESE COSTS DECREASED FROM 13.7% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO 12.1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUES. IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT AREA OF FOCUS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  AS DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018, OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATE TO INCOME RECOGNITION FROM MORTGAGE LOANS; INVENTORIES; UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES; POST-DEVELOPMENT COMPLETION, WARRANTY AND INSURANCE RESERVES; AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. SINCE OCTOBER 31, 2018, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THOSE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  OUR OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND SALES IN THE NORTHEAST (NEW JERSEY AND PENNSYLVANIA), THE MID-ATLANTIC (DELAWARE, MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, WASHINGTON D.C. AND WEST VIRGINIA), THE MIDWEST (ILLINOIS AND OHIO), THE SOUTHEAST (FLORIDA, GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA), THE SOUTHWEST (ARIZONA AND TEXAS) AND THE WEST (CALIFORNIA). IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL SERVICES TO OUR HOMEBUILDING CUSTOMERS.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED OUR HOMEBUILDING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, THE ISSUANCE OF NEW DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES. DUE TO COVENANT RESTRICTIONS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE CAN INCUR THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS REFINANCING INDEBTEDNESS WITH CERTAIN MATURITY REQUIREMENTS (A LIMITATION THAT WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE), EVEN IF MARKET CONDITIONS WOULD OTHERWISE BE FAVORABLE, WHICH COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.  OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES \\u2013 OVERVIEW  OUR HOMEBUILDING CASH BALANCE AT JULY 31, 2019 DECREASED $104.2 MILLION FROM OCTOBER 31, 2018. WE SPENT $400.0 MILLION ON LAND AND LAND DEVELOPMENT DURING THE PERIOD. AFTER CONSIDERING THIS LAND AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AND ALL OTHER OPERATING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING REVENUE RECEIVED FROM DELIVERIES, WE USED $258.1 MILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD $125.0 MILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY (DEFINED BELOW), AND THEREFORE, OUR TOTAL LIQUIDITY AT JULY 31, 2019 WAS $225.1 MILLION, WHICH IS WITHIN OUR TARGET LIQUIDITY RANGE OF $170.0 TO $245.0 MILLION. DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, WE USED $9.5 MILLION OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FOR INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DISTRIBUTIONS FROM JOINT VENTURES. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $159.4 MILLION DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH INCLUDED PROCEEDS OF $21.3 MILLION FROM A DEBT ISSUANCE, $75.8 MILLION FROM LAND BANKING AND MODEL SALE LEASEBACK PROGRAMS AND $112.5 MILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM NONRECOURSE MORTGAGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $46.3 MILLION REDUCTION IN MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE LINES OF CREDIT. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO USE NONRECOURSE MORTGAGE FINANCINGS, MODEL SALE LEASEBACK, JOINT VENTURES, AND, SUBJECT TO COVENANT RESTRICTIONS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, LAND BANKING PROGRAMS AS OUR BUSINESS NEEDS DICTATE.  OUR CASH USES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE FOR OPERATING EXPENSES, LAND PURCHASES, LAND DEPOSITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION SPENDING, DEBT PAYMENTS, STATE INCOME TAXES, INTEREST PAYMENTS, LITIGATION MATTERS AND INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES. DURING THESE PERIODS, WE PROVIDED FOR OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, HOUSING AND LAND SALES, FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, MODEL SALE LEASEBACKS, LAND BANKING TRANSACTIONS, JOINT VENTURES, FINANCIAL SERVICE REVENUES AND OTHER REVENUES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE SOURCES OF CASH TOGETHER WITH OUR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT THROUGH FISCAL 2019 TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  OUR NET INCOME (LOSS) HISTORICALLY DOES NOT APPROXIMATE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NET INCOME (LOSS) AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INVENTORY LEVELS TOGETHER WITH CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES, PREPAID AND OTHER ASSETS, MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR SALE, INTEREST AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, AND NONCASH CHARGES RELATING TO DEPRECIATION, STOCK COMPENSATION AWARDS AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES FOR INVENTORY. WHEN WE ARE EXPANDING OUR OPERATIONS, INVENTORY LEVELS, PREPAIDS AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASE CAUSING CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO DECREASE. CERTAIN LIABILITIES ALSO INCREASE AS OPERATIONS EXPAND AND PARTIALLY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS CAUSED BY THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY LEVELS, PREPAIDS AND OTHER ASSETS. SIMILARLY, AS OUR MORTGAGE OPERATIONS EXPAND, NET INCOME FROM THESE OPERATIONS INCREASES, BUT FOR CASH FLOW PURPOSES NET INCOME IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NET CHANGE IN MORTGAGE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE AS OUR INVESTMENT IN NEW LAND PURCHASES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW COMMUNITIES DECREASE, CAUSING US TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. IN FISCAL 2019 AND 2018, WITH CONTINUED SPENDING ON LAND PURCHASES AND LAND DEVELOPMENT, WE USED CASH IN OPERATIONS. AS WE CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY SEEK LAND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WE WILL ALSO REMAIN FOCUSED ON LIQUIDITY.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEBT TRANSACTIONS  AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD $1,135.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING SENIOR SECURED NOTES ($1,118.0 MILLION, NET OF DISCOUNT AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS), COMPRISED OF $53.2 MILLION 2.0% 2021 NOTES (DEFINED BELOW), $141.8 MILLION 5.0% 2021 NOTES (DEFINED BELOW), $75.0 MILLION 9.5% 2020 NOTES (DEFINED BELOW), $440.0 MILLION 10.0% SENIOR SECURED NOTES DUE 2022 AND $425.0 MILLION 10.5% SENIOR SECURED NOTES DUE 2024.

IN ADDITION, AS OF JULY 31, 2019, THERE WERE $202.5 MILLION ($201.5 MILLION NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS) OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR UNSECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY (\\u201cTERM LOAN FACILITY\\u201d). AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR $125.0 MILLION SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\u201cSECURED CREDIT FACILITY\\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE \\u201cCREDIT FACILITIES\\u201d).

THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ALSO CONTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE LENDERS OR HOLDERS THEREOF TO EXERCISE REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL (AS APPLICABLE), DECLARE THE LOANS MADE UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY (DEFINED BELOW) (THE \\u201cTERM LOANS\\u201d) AND LOANS MADE UNDER THE SECURED CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW) (THE \\u201cSECURED REVOLVING LOANS\\u201d) OR NOTES TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE IF NOT CURED WITHIN APPLICABLE GRACE PERIODS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO MAKE TIMELY PAYMENTS ON THE TERM LOANS, SECURED REVOLVING LOANS OR NOTES OR OTHER MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS, CROSS DEFAULT TO OTHER MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS, THE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS AND SPECIFIED EVENTS OF BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY, WITH RESPECT TO THE TERM LOANS AND SECURED REVOLVING LOANS, MATERIAL INACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND WITH RESPECT TO THE TERM LOANS AND SECURED REVOLVING LOANS, A CHANGE OF CONTROL, AND, WITH RESPECT TO THE SECURED REVOLVING LOANS AND SENIOR SECURED NOTES, THE FAILURE OF THE DOCUMENTS GRANTING SECURITY FOR THE SECURED REVOLVING LOANS AND SENIOR SECURED NOTES TO BE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, AND THE FAILURE OF THE LIENS ON ANY MATERIAL PORTION OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE SECURED REVOLVING LOANS AND SENIOR SECURED NOTES TO BE VALID AND PERFECTED. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE BELIEVE WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  IF OUR CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, IS LESS THAN 2.0 TO 1.0, WE ARE RESTRICTED FROM MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, INCLUDING DIVIDENDS, AND FROM INCURRING INDEBTEDNESS OTHER THAN CERTAIN PERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS, REFINANCING INDEBTEDNESS AND NONRECOURSE INDEBTEDNESS. AS A RESULT OF THIS RATIO RESTRICTION, WE ARE CURRENTLY RESTRICTED FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS, WHICH ARE NOT CUMULATIVE, ON OUR 7.625% SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESTRICTED FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR INABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH COVENANT RESTRICTIONS AND WILL NOT RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT COMPLIANCE WITH ANY OF THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE CERTAIN REDEMPTIONS AND PREPAYMENTS AND, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COVENANT RESTRICTIONS, MAY DO SO FROM TIME TO TIME. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY ANALYZE AND EVALUATE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND EXPLORE TRANSACTIONS TO SIMPLIFY OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND WILL SEEK TO DO SO WITH THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY. WE MAY ALSO CONTINUE TO MAKE DEBT PURCHASES AND/OR EXCHANGES FOR DEBT OR EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH TENDER OFFERS, OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS, OR OTHERWISE, OR SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COVENANT RESTRICTIONS.  ANY LIQUIDITY-ENHANCING OR OTHER CAPITAL RAISING OR REFINANCING TRANSACTION WILL DEPEND ON IDENTIFYING COUNTERPARTIES, NEGOTIATION OF DOCUMENTATION AND APPLICABLE CLOSING CONDITIONS AND ANY REQUIRED APPROVALS. DUE TO COVENANT RESTRICTIONS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE CAN INCUR THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS REFINANCING INDEBTEDNESS WITH CERTAIN MATURITY REQUIREMENTS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE (A LIMITATION THAT WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE), EVEN IF MARKET CONDITIONS WOULD OTHERWISE BE FAVORABLE, WHICH COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.  IN ADDITION TO THE SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAVE CERTAIN STAND\\u2013ALONE CASH COLLATERALIZED LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND FACILITIES UNDER WHICH THERE WAS A TOTAL OF $15.9 MILLION AND $12.5 MILLION LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AGREEMENTS AND FACILITIES REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF CASH AS COLLATERAL IN SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS TO SUPPORT THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED THEREUNDER, WHICH WILL AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER USES. AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL IN THESE SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS WAS $16.5 MILLION AND $12.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN \\u201cRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\\u201d ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND K. HOVNANIAN\\u2019S SENIOR SECURED NOTES AND SENIOR NOTES.  MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE  WE HAVE NONRECOURSE MORTGAGE LOANS FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITIES TOTALING $207.2 MILLION AND $95.6 MILLION (NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS) AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE SECURED BY THE RELATED REAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPROVEMENTS, WITH AN AGGREGATE BOOK VALUE OF $409.3 MILLION AND $241.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS 8.1% AND 6.1% AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE MORTGAGE LOAN PAYMENTS ON EACH COMMUNITY PRIMARILY CORRESPOND TO HOME DELIVERIES.  OUR WHOLLY OWNED MORTGAGE BANKING SUBSIDIARY, K. HOVNANIAN AMERICAN MORTGAGE, LLC (\\u201cK. HOVNANIAN MORTGAGE\\u201d), ORIGINATES MORTGAGE LOANS PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF OUR HOMES. SUCH MORTGAGE LOANS AND RELATED SERVICING RIGHTS ARE SOLD IN THE SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WE RETAIN THE SERVICING RIGHTS FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF LOANS. THE LOANS ARE SECURED BY THE MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE AND REPAID WHEN WE SELL THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS TO PERMANENT INVESTORS. AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE OF $66.9 MILLION AND $113.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OUTSTANDING UNDER SEVERAL OF K. HOVNANIAN MORTGAGE\\u2019S SHORT-TERM BORROWING FACILITIES.  SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE AGREEMENTS.  INVENTORY ACTIVITIES  TOTAL INVENTORY, EXCLUDING CONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED, INCREASED $185.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 FROM OCTOBER 31, 2018. TOTAL INVENTORY, EXCLUDING CONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED, INCREASED IN THE NORTHEAST BY $32.9 MILLION, IN THE MID-ATLANTIC BY $40.3 MILLION, IN THE MIDWEST BY $15.6 MILLION, IN THE SOUTHEAST BY $15.8 MILLION, IN THE SOUTHWEST BY $51.7 MILLION AND IN THE WEST BY $28.8 MILLION. THE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW LAND PURCHASES AND LAND DEVELOPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HOME DELIVERIES DURING THE PERIOD. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD IMPAIRMENTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.1 MILLION. WE WROTE-OFF COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $2.5 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 RELATED TO LAND OPTIONS THAT EXPIRED OR THAT WE TERMINATED, AS THE COMMUNITIES\\u2019 FORECASTED PROFITABILITY WAS NOT PROJECTED TO PRODUCE ADEQUATE RETURNS ON INVESTMENT COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE NEW LAND PARCELS AT PRICES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL GENERATE REASONABLE RETURNS UNDER CURRENT HOMEBUILDING MARKET CONDITIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE IN THE NEAR TERM. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL HOMES UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR COMPLETED AND INCLUDED IN INVENTORY AT JULY 31, 2019 ARE EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED DURING THE NEXT SIX TO NINE MONTHS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED INCREASED $91.7 MILLION. CONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED CONSISTS OF OPTIONS RELATED TO LAND BANKING AND MODEL FINANCING TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE ADDED TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP. THE INCREASE FROM OCTOBER 31, 2018 TO JULY 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LAND BANKING TRANSACTIONS ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN THE SALE AND LEASEBACK OF CERTAIN MODEL HOMES DURING THE PERIOD. WE HAVE LAND BANKING ARRANGEMENTS, WHEREBY WE SELL LAND PARCELS TO THE LAND BANKERS AND THEY PROVIDE US AN OPTION TO PURCHASE BACK FINISHED LOTS ON A PREDETERMINED SCHEDULE. BECAUSE OF OUR OPTIONS TO REPURCHASE THESE PARCELS, FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606-10-55-70, THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONSIDERED A FINANCING RATHER THAN A SALE. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AT JULY 31, 2019, INVENTORY OF $123.8 MILLION WAS RECORDED TO \\u201cCONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED,\\u201d WITH A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF $87.7 MILLION (NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS) RECORDED TO \\u201cLIABILITIES FROM INVENTORY NOT OWNED\\u201d FOR THE AMOUNT OF NET CASH RECEIVED FROM THE TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE SELL AND LEASE BACK CERTAIN OF OUR MODEL HOMES WITH THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POTENTIAL PROFIT WHEN EACH HOME IS SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY AT THE END OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASE. AS A RESULT OF OUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT, FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606-10-55-68, THESE SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE CONSIDERED A FINANCING RATHER THAN A SALE. THEREFORE, FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AT JULY 31, 2019, INVENTORY OF $55.8 MILLION WAS RECORDED TO \\u201cCONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED,\\u201d WITH A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF $50.7 MILLION (NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS) RECORDED TO \\u201cLIABILITIES FROM INVENTORY NOT OWNED\\u201d FOR THE AMOUNT OF NET CASH RECEIVED FROM THE TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO OPTION AGREEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS, WHEREBY WE ARE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF LOTS. BECAUSE OF OUR OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE THESE LOTS, FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360-20-40-38, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECORD THIS INVENTORY ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD NO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OPTIONS.  WHEN POSSIBLE, WE OPTION PROPERTY FOR DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO ACQUISITION. BY OPTIONING PROPERTY, WE ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO THE LOSS OF THE COST OF THE OPTION AND PREDEVELOPMENT COSTS IF WE CHOOSE NOT TO EXERCISE THE OPTION (OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OPTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE). AS A RESULT, OUR COMMITMENT FOR MAJOR LAND ACQUISITIONS IS REDUCED. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONED PROPERTIES ARE INCLUDED IN \\u201cLAND AND LAND OPTIONS HELD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OR SALE\\u201d ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ALSO INCLUDED IN \\u201cLAND AND LAND OPTIONS HELD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OR SALE\\u201d ARE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH INVENTORY IN MOTHBALLED COMMUNITIES. WE MOTHBALL (OR STOP DEVELOPMENT ON) CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WHEN WE DETERMINE THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE DOES NOT JUSTIFY FURTHER INVESTMENT AT THE TIME. THAT IS, WE BELIEVE WE WILL GENERATE HIGHER RETURNS IF WE DECIDE AGAINST SPENDING MONEY TO IMPROVE LAND TODAY AND SAVE THE RAW LAND UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE MARKETS IMPROVE OR WE DETERMINE TO SELL THE PROPERTY. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD MOTHBALLED LAND IN 14 COMMUNITIES. THE BOOK VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE COMMUNITIES AT JULY 31, 2019 WAS $14.2 MILLION, WHICH WAS NET OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS OF $146.9 MILLION. WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW COMMUNITIES TO DETERMINE IF MOTHBALLING IS APPROPRIATE. DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, WE DID NOT MOTHBALL ANY ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES, BUT WE SOLD TWO PREVIOUSLY MOTHBALLED COMMUNITIES AND RE-ACTIVATED TWO PREVIOUSLY MOTHBALLED COMMUNITIES.  INVENTORIES HELD FOR SALE, WHICH ARE LAND PARCELS WHERE WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO BUILD HOMES AND ARE ACTIVELY MARKETING THE LAND FOR SALE, REPRESENTED $1.2 MILLION AND $6.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL INVENTORIES AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, AND ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE FOR LAND HELD FOR SALE, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PRICES FOR LAND IN RECENT COMPARABLE SALE TRANSACTIONS, MARKET ANALYSIS STUDIES, WHICH INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED PRICE A WILLING BUYER WOULD PAY FOR THE LAND (OTHER THAN IN A FORCED LIQUIDATION SALE) AND RECENT BONA FIDE OFFERS RECEIVED FROM OUTSIDE THIRD PARTIES.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE HOME SITES INCLUDED IN OUR TOTAL RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE.

FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES RECEIVABLE HELD FOR SALE OF WHICH $82.2 MILLION AND $129.0 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WERE BEING TEMPORARILY WAREHOUSED AND ARE AWAITING SALE IN THE SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET. THE DECREASE IN MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR SALE FROM OCTOBER 31, 2018 IS RELATED TO A DECREASE IN THE VOLUME OF LOANS ORIGINATED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN DELIVERIES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES OTHER ASSETS WAS A DECREASE IN RESTRICTED CASH DUE TO THE TIMING OF HOME CLOSINGS AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  NONRECOURSE MORTGAGES SECURED BY INVENTORY INCREASED TO $207.2 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2019 FROM $95.6 MILLION AT OCTOBER 31, 2018.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE OVERALL INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED HOUSING REVENUES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF DELIVERIES AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN COMMUNITY COUNT AND BY THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SALES PRICE. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OVER YEAR QUARTERLY INCREASE IN REVENUES AND DELIVERIES SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016 AND IS THE RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS TO GROW COMMUNITY COUNT AND LOTS CONTROLLED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE OVERALL DECREASE IN CONSOLIDATED HOUSING REVENUES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE IN THE VOLUME OF DELIVERIES AS A RESULT OF NEW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT YET DELIVERING HOMES.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR FUTURE RESULTS ARE RECENTLY SIGNED CONTRACTS AND OUR HOME CONTRACT BACKLOG FOR FUTURE DELIVERIES.

IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, OUR OPEN FOR SALE COMMUNITY COUNT INCREASED TO 138 FROM 123 AT OCTOBER 31, 2018, WHICH IS THE NET RESULT OF OPENING 67 NEW COMMUNITIES AND CLOSING 49 COMMUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTING AND/OR SELLING THREE COMMUNITIES TO A NEW JOINT VENTURE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019. OUR REPORTED LEVEL OF SALES CONTRACTS (NET OF CANCELLATIONS) INCREASED AS A RESULT OF OUR HIGHER COMMUNITY COUNT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, ALONG WITH HIGHER SALES ABSORPTION. WITH RESPECT TO OUR SALES ABSORPTION, NET CONTRACTS PER AVERAGE ACTIVE SELLING COMMUNITY FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS 29.4 COMPARED TO 27.9 FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

CANCELLATIONS ALSO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF A BUYER\\u2019S FAILURE TO QUALIFY FOR A MORTGAGE, WHICH GENERALLY OCCURS DURING THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AFTER SIGNING. AS SHOWN IN THE TABLES ABOVE, CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN WITHIN WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A NORMAL RANGE. HOWEVER, MARKET CONDITIONS ARE UNCERTAIN AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT CANCELLATION RATES WILL BE IN THE FUTURE.  TOTAL COST OF SALES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDES EXPENSES FOR CONSOLIDATED HOUSING AND LAND AND LOT SALES, INCLUDING INVENTORY IMPAIRMENT LOSS AND LAND OPTION WRITE-OFFS (DEFINED AS \\u201cLAND CHARGES\\u201d IN THE TABLES BELOW). A BREAKOUT OF SUCH EXPENSES FOR HOUSING SALES AND HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN IS SET FORTH BELOW.  HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. THIS MEASURE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE ENABLES INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THIS MEASURE IS ALSO USEFUL INTERNALLY, HELPING MANAGEMENT EVALUATE OUR OPERATING RESULTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. IN PARTICULAR, THE MAGNITUDE AND VOLATILITY OF LAND CHARGES FOR THE COMPANY, AND FOR OTHER HOMEBUILDERS, HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND, AS SUCH, HAVE MADE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF OUR INDUSTRY MORE DIFFICULT.

AS A RESULT, DEPENDING ON THE MIX OF COMMUNITIES DELIVERING HOMES, CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN MAY FLUCTUATE UP OR DOWN. TOTAL HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED TO 14.0% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 15.4% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND DECREASED TO 14.0% DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 14.6% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN COST OF SALES INTEREST AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF INTEREST PER HOME FOR DELIVERIES IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SEMI-ANNUAL COMMUNITY LIFE PLANNING PROCESS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE IS THE MIX OF COMMUNITIES DELIVERING COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR, ALONG WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN DIRECT COSTS AND FINANCING CONCESSIONS. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, GROSS MARGIN WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REVERSAL OF PRIOR PERIOD INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS OF $26.7 MILLION AND $41.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH REPRESENTED 2.1% AND 3.1%, RESPECTIVELY, OF \\u201cSALE OF HOMES\\u201d REVENUE. GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES, REMAINED THE SAME AT 18.4% FOR BOTH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 AND JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AND DECREASED FROM 18.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO 17.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MIX OF COMMUNITIES DELIVERING HOMES IN EACH PERIOD, ALONG WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN DIRECT COSTS AND FINANCING CONCESSIONS.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REFLECTED AS INVENTORY IMPAIRMENT LOSS AND LAND OPTION WRITE-OFFS IN COST OF SALES, WE HAVE WRITTEN-OFF OR WRITTEN-DOWN CERTAIN INVENTORIES TOTALING $1.4 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND $3.6 MILLION AND $3.2 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, WE WROTE-OFF RESIDENTIAL LAND OPTIONS AND APPROVAL AND ENGINEERING COSTS AMOUNTING TO $1.3 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $0.1 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL LAND CHARGES DISCUSSED ABOVE.

SUCH WRITE-OFFS WERE LOCATED IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, AND IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS EXCEPT THE SOUTHEAST FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018. WE RECORDED $0.1 MILLION OF INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AND $1.1 MILLION AND $2.1 MILLION IN INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE DID NOT RECORD INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. THE IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THREE COMMUNITIES IN THE MID-ATLANTIC, SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST. THE IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THREE COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTHEAST. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER IMPAIRMENT LEVELS WILL REMAIN LOW. SHOULD WE DECIDE TO FURTHER LOWER PRICES OR HAVE FURTHER LAND SALES, OR SHOULD THE ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS USED IN DETERMINING ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS OR FAIR VALUE DECREASE OR DIFFER FROM CURRENT ESTIMATES IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY NEED TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENTS.  LAND SALES AND OTHER REVENUES.  LAND SALES AND OTHER REVENUES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF LAND AND LOT SALES. A BREAKOUT OF LAND AND LOT SALES IS SET FORTH BELOW.

ALTHOUGH WE BUDGET LAND SALES, THEY ARE OFTEN DEPENDENT UPON RECEIVING APPROVALS AND ENTITLEMENTS, THE TIMING OF WHICH CAN BE UNCERTAIN. AS A RESULT, PROJECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF LAND SALES IS DIFFICULT. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH LAND SALES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO THE MIX OF LAND PARCELS SOLD. THERE WAS ONE LAND SALE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND NONE IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THERE WERE FIVE LAND SALES IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO TWO IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019 OCCURRED DESPITE THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LAND SALES, DEMONSTRATING THE IMPACT THE MIX OF LAND SALES CAN HAVE ON LAND SALE REVENUES.  LAND SALES AND OTHER REVENUES INCREASED $0.6 MILLION AND DECREASED $15.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OTHER REVENUES INCLUDE INCOME FROM CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS, WHERE THE DEPOSIT HAS BEEN FORFEITED DUE TO CONTRACT TERMINATIONS, INTEREST INCOME, CASH DISCOUNTS AND MISCELLANEOUS ONE-TIME RECEIPTS. FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, THE FLUCTUATION WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN LAND SALES REVENUES NOTED ABOVE. THE DECREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS ALSO PARTIALLY DUE TO THE $3.6 MILLION GAIN RECOGNIZED FROM THE SALE OF OUR FORMER CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HOMEBUILDING SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE OF JOINT VENTURE MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED OF $3.1 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH OFFSET GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS A RESULT OF LESS UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE DELIVERIES, AND AN ADJUSTMENT TO OUR INSURANCE RESERVES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 DUE TO A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT, WHICH REDUCED SGA COSTS BY $2.3 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. SGA EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOMEBUILDING REVENUES INCREASED TO 9.3% AND 10.3% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 8.5% AND 9.4% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  TOTAL SGA EXPENSES (INCLUDING CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES) PER OPEN FOR SALE COMMUNITY DECREASED FROM $439,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO $424,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AND DECREASED FROM $1,359,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO $1,318,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS A RESULT OF OUR INCREASED COMMUNITY COUNT. THESE DECREASES WERE THE RESULT OF OUR OPEN FOR SALE COMMUNITY COUNT INCREASING 12.2% AND 3.8% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS, WHILE OUR TOTAL SGA EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WERE ONLY UP 8.5% AND 0.7%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THIS EFFICIENCY IN SGA EXPENSES PER OPEN FOR SALE COMMUNITY IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF OUR STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR SGA EXPENSES RELATIVE TO TOTAL REVENUES AS HOME DELIVERIES BEGIN TO OCCUR FROM OUR INCREASED NUMBER OF NEWLY OPENED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT NEXT YEAR. AS WE START GETTING A GREATER NUMBER OF DELIVERIES FROM OUR GROWING COMMUNITY COUNT, WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE OUR COSTS AND IMPROVE OUR SGA EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.

THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SALES PRICE WAS THE RESULT OF NEW COMMUNITIES DELIVERING HIGHER PRICED, LARGER SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN HIGHER-END SUBMARKETS OF THE SEGMENT IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO SOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NO LONGER DELIVERING AND WHICH HAD LOWER PRICED, SMALLER SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN LOWER-END SUBMARKETS OF THE SEGMENT IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 THAT ARE NO LONGER DELIVERING.  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES DECREASED $3.9 MILLION TO $8.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN HOMEBUILDING REVENUE DISCUSSED ABOVE, A $1.4 MILLION DECREASE IN INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES TO A LOSS, WHILE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  HOMEBUILDING REVENUES DECREASED 6.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 5.6% DECREASE IN HOMES DELIVERED AND A 1.3% DECREASE IN AVERAGE SALES PRICE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SALES PRICE WAS THE RESULT OF NEW COMMUNITIES DELIVERING LOWER PRICED, SMALLER SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN LOWER-END SUBMARKETS OF THE SEGMENT IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO SOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NO LONGER DELIVERING AND WHICH HAD HIGHER PRICED, LARGER SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN HIGHER-END SUBMARKETS OF THE SEGMENT IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 THAT ARE NO LONGER DELIVERING.  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES DECREASED $12.7 MILLION COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR TO $15.3 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO THE DECREASE IN HOMEBUILDING REVENUES DISCUSSED ABOVE AND A SLIGHT DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  WEST  - HOMEBUILDING REVENUES INCREASED 28.1% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A 28.9% INCREASE IN HOMES DELIVERED, WHILE AVERAGE SALES PRICE WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT WITH A 0.7% DECREASE.  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES DECREASED $7.9 MILLION TO $6.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $1.7 MILLION INCREASE IN SGA COSTS AND A DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  HOMEBUILDING REVENUES INCREASED 19.6% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO AN 18.0% INCREASE IN HOMES DELIVERED AND A 1.4% INCREASE IN AVERAGE SALES PRICE. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SALES PRICE WAS THE RESULT OF NEW COMMUNITIES DELIVERING HIGHER PRICED, SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN MID TO HIGHER-END SUBMARKETS OF THE SEGMENT IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO SOME COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NO LONGER DELIVERING THAT HAD LOWER PRICED, SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN LOWER-END SUBMARKETS OF THE SEGMENT IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 THAT ARE NO LONGER DELIVERING.  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES DECREASED $1.1 MILLION TO $28.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO A $1.0 MILLION DECREASE IN INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES TO A LOSS AND A $4.5 MILLION INCREASE IN SGA COSTS, WHILE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS FLAT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL SERVICES  FINANCIAL SERVICES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ORIGINATING MORTGAGES FROM OUR HOME BUYERS, SELLING SUCH MORTGAGES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET, AND TITLE INSURANCE ACTIVITIES. WE USE MANDATORY INVESTOR COMMITMENTS AND FORWARD SALES OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (\\u201cMBS\\u201d) TO HEDGE OUR MORTGAGE-RELATED INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE ON AGENCY AND GOVERNMENT LOANS. THESE INSTRUMENTS INVOLVE, TO VARYING DEGREES, ELEMENTS OF CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MBS FORWARD COMMITMENTS AND LOAN SALES TRANSACTIONS IS MANAGED BY LIMITING OUR COUNTERPARTIES TO INVESTMENT BANKS, FEDERALLY REGULATED BANK AFFILIATES AND OTHER INVESTORS MEETING OUR CREDIT STANDARDS. OUR RISK, IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE PURCHASER, IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACT PRICE AND FAIR VALUE OF THE MBS FORWARD COMMITMENTS. FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 AND 2018, FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION AND VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (\\u201cFHA/VA\\u201d) LOANS REPRESENTED 29.4% AND 25.2%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL LOANS. THE ORIGINATION OF FHA/VA LOANS HAVE INCREASED FROM THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018 TO THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 AND OUR CONFORMING CONVENTIONAL LOAN ORIGINATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL LOANS DECREASED FROM 69.7% TO 66.0% FOR THESE PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE ORIGINATION OF LOANS WHICH EXCEED CONFORMING CONVENTIONS HAVE DECREASED FROM 5.0% FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018 TO 4.6% FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019. PROFITS AND LOSSES RELATING TO THE SALE OF MORTGAGE LOANS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN LEGAL CONTROL PASSES TO THE BUYER OF THE MORTGAGE AND THE SALES PRICE IS COLLECTED.  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDED A $3.8 MILLION AND $8.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF PRETAX PROFIT COMPARED TO $4.0 MILLION AND $10.8 MILLION OF PRETAX PROFIT, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL 2018. THE DECREASE IN PRETAX PROFIT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 IS THE DECREASE IN THE BASIS POINT SPREAD BETWEEN THE LOANS ORIGINATED AND THE IMPLIED RATE FROM THE SALE OF THE LOANS AS A RESULT OF THE COMPETITIVE FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKET. FURTHER IMPACTING THE DECREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO JULY 31, 2018 IS THE DECREASE IN HOMEBUILDING DELIVERIES. IN THE MARKET AREAS SERVED BY OUR WHOLLY OWNED MORTGAGE BANKING SUBSIDIARIES, 69.0% AND 71.7% OF OUR NONCASH HOMEBUYERS OBTAINED MORTGAGES ORIGINATED BY THESE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND 69.3% AND 70.9% OF OUR NONCASH HOMEBUYERS OBTAINED MORTGAGES ORIGINATED BY THESE SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. SERVICING RIGHTS ON NEW MORTGAGES ORIGINATED BY US ARE SOLD WITH THE LOANS.  CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE THE OPERATIONS AT OUR HEADQUARTERS IN NEW JERSEY. THESE EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, STOCK COMPENSATION, FACILITY COSTS AND RENT AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICES, INFORMATION SERVICES, HUMAN RESOURCES, CORPORATE ACCOUNTING, TRAINING, TREASURY, PROCESS REDESIGN, INTERNAL AUDIT, CONSTRUCTION SERVICES AND ADMINISTRATION OF INSURANCE, QUALITY AND SAFETY. CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED TO $15.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $16.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, AND DECREASED TO $48.8 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $51.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. THE DECREASE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED LEGAL FEES (INCLUDING LITIGATION) RELATED TO FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND HIGHER COSTS FOR ONGOING LITIGATIONS INVOLVING THE COMPANY IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THE PRIOR YEAR WHICH DID NOT RECUR IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THE CURRENT YEAR. ALSO IMPACTING THE DECREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RESERVES FOR SELF-INSURED MEDICAL CLAIMS, WHICH WERE REDUCED BASED ON CLAIM ESTIMATES.  OTHER INTEREST  OTHER INTEREST DECREASED $2.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 AND DECREASED $12.8 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. OUR ASSETS THAT QUALIFY FOR INTEREST CAPITALIZATION (INVENTORY UNDER DEVELOPMENT) ARE LESS THAN OUR DEBT, AND THEREFORE THE PORTION OF INTEREST NOT COVERED BY QUALIFYING ASSETS IS DIRECTLY EXPENSED. OTHER INTEREST DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR ASSETS THAT QUALIFY FOR INTEREST CAPITALIZATION INCREASED BY MORE THAN OUR DEBT, THEREFORE THE AMOUNT OF DIRECTLY EXPENSED INTEREST DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2018, K. HOVNANIAN CLOSED CERTAIN OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AS FOLLOWS: (I) K. HOVNANIAN BORROWED THE INITIAL TERM LOANS IN THE AMOUNT OF $132.5 MILLION UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY, AND PROCEEDS OF SUCH INITIAL TERM LOANS, TOGETHER WITH CASH ON HAND, WERE USED TO REDEEM ALL OF K. HOVNANIAN\\u2019S OUTSTANDING $132.5 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 7.0% NOTES (UPON REDEMPTION, ALL 7.0% NOTES WERE CANCELLED); AND (II) K. HOVNANIAN ACCEPTED ALL OF THE $170.2 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 8.0% NOTES VALIDLY TENDERED AND NOT VALIDLY WITHDRAWN IN THE EXCHANGE OFFER (REPRESENTING 72.14% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 8.0% NOTES OUTSTANDING PRIOR TO THE EXCHANGE OFFER), AND IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, K. HOVNANIAN ISSUED $90.6 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NEW 2026 NOTES AND $90.1 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NEW 2040 NOTES, UNDER A NEW INDENTURE AND AS PART OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER, THE SUBSIDIARY PURCHASER, PURCHASED FOR $26.5 MILLION IN CASH THE PURCHASED 8.0% NOTES. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE TRANSACTIONS RESULTED IN A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $1.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN \\u201cLOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT\\u201d ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ON MAY 29, 2018, K. HOVNANIAN COMPLETED THE REDEMPTION OF $65.7 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 8.0% NOTES (UPON REDEMPTION, SUCH 8.0% NOTES WERE CANCELLED) WITH APPROXIMATELY $70.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS ON THE DELAYED DRAW TERM LOANS UNDER THE UNSECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY. THIS TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $4.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN \\u201cLOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT\\u201d ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES  INCOME (LOSS) FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES CONSISTS OF OUR SHARE OF THE EARNINGS OR LOSSES OF OUR JOINT VENTURES. INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES DECREASED $7.0 MILLION TO $3.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES INCREASED $13.7 MILLION TO $20.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS IS DUE TO CERTAIN OF OUR JOINT VENTURES DELIVERING LESS HOMES, RESULTING IN LOWER PROFITS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL THIRD QUARTER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS RECOGNIZING THE LOSS FROM WRITING DOWN THE INVESTMENT OF ONE OF OUR JOINT VENTURES WHERE THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE INVESTMENT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE NINE MONTHS IS DUE TO OUR SHARE OF INCOME FROM CERTAIN OF OUR JOINT VENTURES DELIVERING MORE HOMES, RESULTING IN INCREASED PROFITS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR WHEN THEY REPORTED LOSSES PRIMARILY DUE TO STARTUP COSTS OR HAVING JUST BEGUN DELIVERING HOMES.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TOTAL TAXES  THE TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $0.5 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION RECOGNIZED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AND $1.1 MILLION AND $1.7 MILLION RECOGNIZED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO STATE TAX EXPENSE FROM INCOME GENERATED THAT WAS NOT OFFSET BY TAX BENEFITS IN STATES WHERE WE FULLY RESERVE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES.  INFLATION  INFLATION HAS A LONG-TERM EFFECT, BECAUSE INCREASING COSTS OF LAND, MATERIALS AND LABOR RESULT IN INCREASING SALE PRICES OF OUR HOMES. IN GENERAL, THESE PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN COMMENSURATE WITH THE GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN OUR HOUSING MARKETS AND HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE SALE OF OUR HOMES. A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACED BY THE HOUSING INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS THAT RISING HOUSE CONSTRUCTION COSTS, INCLUDING LAND AND INTEREST COSTS, WILL SUBSTANTIALLY OUTPACE INCREASES IN THE INCOME OF POTENTIAL PURCHASERS AND THEREFORE LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE HOME SALE PRICES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  INFLATION HAS A LESSER SHORT-TERM EFFECT, BECAUSE WE GENERALLY NEGOTIATE FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS WITH MANY, BUT NOT ALL, OF OUR SUBCONTRACTORS AND MATERIAL SUPPLIERS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR HOMES. THESE PRICES USUALLY ARE APPLICABLE FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS OR FOR A TIME PERIOD OF BETWEEN THREE TO TWELVE MONTHS. CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 54.1% OF OUR HOMEBUILDING COST OF SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING DEVELOPER OF SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING SOLUTIONS FOR VIDEO THAT ENABLE HIGH-DEFINITION, OR HD, VIDEO CAPTURE, ANALYSIS, SHARING AND DISPLAY. A DEVICE THAT CAPTURES VIDEO INCLUDES FOUR PRIMARY COMPONENTS: A LENS, AN IMAGE SENSOR, A VIDEO PROCESSOR AND STORAGE MEMORY. THE VIDEO PROCESSOR CONVERTS RAW VIDEO INPUT INTO A FORMAT THAT CAN BE STORED AND DISTRIBUTED EFFICIENTLY AND, IN SOME CASES, ANALYZES THE VIDEO DATA TO AUTOMATE PROCESSES. WE COMBINE OUR PROCESSOR DESIGN CAPABILITIES WITH OUR EXPERTISE IN VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING, COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE EASILY SCALABLE ACROSS MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS AND ENABLE RAPID AND EFFICIENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR SYSTEM-ON-A-CHIP, OR SOC, DESIGNS FULLY INTEGRATE HD VIDEO PROCESSING, IMAGE PROCESSING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OR AI, COMPUTER VISION, OR CV, FUNCTIONALITY, AUDIO PROCESSING, AND SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ONTO A SINGLE CHIP, DELIVERING EXCEPTIONAL VIDEO AND IMAGE QUALITY AT HIGH COMPRESSION RATES, DIFFERENTIATED FUNCTIONALITY AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION.  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN EXPANDING OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY THAT WE BELIEVE COMPLEMENTS OUR IMAGE PROCESSING AND VIDEO COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY, AND BUILDS A FOUNDATION TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES IN AI AND CV APPLICATIONS FOR A VARIETY OF MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT ENHANCED COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITY IS CRITICAL BOTH TO OUR CURRENT VIDEO MARKETS, SUCH AS IP SECURITY CAMERA, AS WELL AS FUTURE MARKETS SUCH AS AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER, OR OEM, CAMERAS FOR ADVANCED DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS, OR ADAS, AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, AND ROBOTICS. OUR RECENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON CREATING ADVANCED COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE, LOW-POWER HARDWARE PLATFORMS TO ENHANCE PROCESSING ACCELERATION, WHICH WE REFER TO AS OUR CVFLOW ARCHITECTURE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY HIGHLY-OPTIMIZED AI COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY WITH OUR VIDEO PROCESSOR PROVIDES AN OPTIMIZED CV PLATFORM. IN 2017, WE INTRODUCED OUR FIRST COMPUTER VISION SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP, THE CV1 SOC. IN 2018, WE INTRODUCED THREE NEW COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOCS TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP INTELLIGENT CAMERA SYSTEMS FOR A VARIETY OF MARKETS AT DIFFERENT FEATURE LEVELS.  24  OUR REVENUE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN GENERATED PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF OUR SOC SOLUTIONS FOR INCORPORATION INTO SPECI  ALIZED VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES SUCH AS WEARABLE SPORTS CAMERAS, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET CAMERAS, IP SECURITY CAMERAS AND CAMERAS INCORPORATED INTO UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES, OR UAVS OR DRONES. OUR REVENUE FROM SEVERAL OF THESE MARKETS, HOWEVER, HAS R  ECENTLY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES.  AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH, IF ANY, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND WITHIN THE CAMERA MARKETS WITH OUR VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOC SOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE  PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY AND HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING CAMERA MARKETS, AS WELL AS EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMPARISON TO PRIOR PERIODS AS WE DE  VOTE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOLUTIONS WITH INCREASED FUNCTIONALITY, SUCH AS COMPUTER VISION CAPABILITIES, AND AS WE TARGET NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  WE SELL OUR SOC SOLUTIONS TO LEADING ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS, OR ODMS, AND OEMS GLOBALLY, AND IN THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET, WE ALSO SELL TO TIER-1 SUPPLIERS TO OEMS. WE REFER TO ODMS AND TIER-1 AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AS OUR CUSTOMERS AND OEMS AS OUR END CUSTOMERS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE INDICATED OR AS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES. IN THE CAMERA MARKET, OUR SOLUTIONS ENABLE THE CREATION OF HIGH-QUALITY VIDEO CONTENT IN WEARABLE CAMERAS, AUTOMOTIVE CAMERAS, INTERNET PROTOCOL, OR IP, SECURITY CAMERAS, FOR BOTH PROFESSIONAL USE AND HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING, UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE CAMERAS, ALSO REFERRED TO AS UAVS OR DRONES, AND VIRTUAL REALITY CAMERAS, ALSO REFERRED TO AS 360\\u00b0 CAMERAS. WE ALSO RECENTLY INTRODUCED, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS EMERGING MARKETS, SUCH AS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITIES FOR AI-ENABLED SECURITY CAMERAS, AI-BASED DRIVING APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-PARKING, DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEMS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR HD MAPPING SOLUTIONS, OEM AUTOMOTIVE ADAS APPLICATIONS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  OUR SALES CYCLES TYPICALLY REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF TIME AND A SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES BEFORE WE CAN REALIZE REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF OUR SOLUTIONS, IF ANY. OUR TYPICAL SALES CYCLE CONSISTS OF A MULTI-MONTH SALES AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INVOLVING OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 SYSTEM DESIGNERS AND MANAGEMENT ALONG WITH OUR SALES PERSONNEL AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS PROCESS CULMINATES IN A CUSTOMER\\u2019S DECISION TO USE OUR SOLUTIONS IN ITS SYSTEM, WHICH WE REFER TO AS A DESIGN WIN. OUR SALES EFFORTS ARE TYPICALLY DIRECTED TO THE OEM OF THE PRODUCT THAT WILL INCORPORATE OUR VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOLUTION, BUT THE EVENTUAL DESIGN AND INCORPORATION OF OUR SOC INTO THE PRODUCT MAY BE HANDLED BY AN ODM ON BEHALF OF THE OEM. IN SOME OF THE NEW MARKETS WE ARE ADDRESSING, SUCH AS AI-BASED AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS, IT MAY TAKE LONGER AND REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES TO SECURE DESIGN WINS THAN IN OUR TRADITIONAL MARKETS.  VOLUME PRODUCTION MAY BEGIN WITHIN SIX TO 18 MONTHS OR EVEN LONGER AFTER A DESIGN WIN, DEPENDING ON THE TARGETED MARKET, THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR CUSTOMER\\u2019S PRODUCT AND OTHER FACTORS UPON WHICH WE MAY HAVE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE. ONCE ONE OF OUR SOLUTIONS HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO A CUSTOMER\\u2019S DESIGN, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOLUTION IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A COMPONENT OF THE CUSTOMER\\u2019S PRODUCT FOR ITS LIFE CYCLE BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH REDESIGNING A PRODUCT OR SUBSTITUTING AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION. CONVERSELY, A DESIGN LOSS TO A COMPETITOR WILL LIKELY PRECLUDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GENERATE FUTURE REVENUE FROM SUCH CUSTOMER\\u2019S PRODUCT. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN A DESIGN WIN AND OUR SOC REMAINS A COMPONENT THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE OF A CUSTOMER\\u2019S PRODUCT, THE VOLUME AND TIMING OF ACTUAL SALES OF OUR SOCS TO THE CUSTOMER DEPEND UPON THE PRODUCTION, RELEASE AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THAT PRODUCT, NONE OF WHICH ARE WITHIN OUR CONTROL. A PORTABLE CONSUMER DEVICE TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF SIX TO 18 MONTHS, WHILE AN IP SECURITY CAMERA TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 12 TO 24 MONTHS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRODUCT LIFECYCLES WILL TYPICALLY BE LONGER THAN 24 MONTHS IN THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THESE MARKETS.  25  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND TRENDS  \\u2022  WE RECORDED REVENUE OF $56.4 MILLION AND $103.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THIS REPRESENTED DECREASES OF 9.7% AND 13.2% FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASES IN REVENUE WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS, INCLUDING SPORTS CAMERA, NON-SPORTS WEARABLE CAMERA, VIRTUAL REALITY, AND DRONE MARKETS. THE DECREASES WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRINCIPALLY THE VIDEO RECORDER MARKET, CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM A LARGE AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASED REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED REVENUE IN THE CONSUMER IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, LED BY HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING MARKET IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION.  IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE CHINA AND EUROPE REGIONS, AND INITIAL RAMPS OF OUR COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOLUTIONS IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. IN THE SPORTS CAMERA MARKET, INCORPORATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS INTO NEWLY LAUNCHED SPORTS CAMERA PRODUCTS FROM DAJIANG INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INC., OR DJI, PARTIALLY OFFSET REVENUE LOSS FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO GOPRO, INC. OR GOPRO.  \\u2022  WE RECORDED OPERATING LOSSES OF $10.4 MILLION AND $28.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO OPERATING LOSSES OF $6.7 MILLION AND $16.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASED OPERATING LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED, PRIMARILY IN SUPPORT OF NEW APPLICATIONS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOLUTIONS, BUT WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE RECOGNITION OF APPROXIMATELY $3.2 MILLION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GRANTS FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES RELATED PRIMARILY TO INCREASED ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT AND INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  \\u2022  WE GENERATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $13.4 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $7.0 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES AS A RESULT OF DECREASED REVENUE AND INCREASED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LARGER NET LOSS, INCREASED NON-CASH EXPENSES, DECREASED CASH RECEIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND INCREASED PURCHASES OF OTHER ASSETS.  \\u2022  EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2019, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\\u201cASC\\u201d) TOPIC 842, LEASES. UNDER THIS NEW GUIDANCE, WE RECOGNIZE LEASES AS RIGHT-OF-USE (\\u201cROU\\u201d) ASSETS AND CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITIES AT THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS, WHILE RECOGNIZING LEASE EXPENSES UNDER STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD THROUGH THE LEASE TERM  . AS OF JULY 31, 2019, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY $7.2 MILLION OF ROU ASSETS, NET OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND $7.4 MILLION OF LEASE LIABILITIES RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION OF LEASE EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY, RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \\u2022  ON MAY 29, 2019, THE COMPANY\\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL REPURCHASE OF UP TO $50.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ORDINARY SHARES COMMENCING IMMEDIATELY THROUGH JUNE 30, 2020. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME-TO-TIME THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, 10B5-1 PLANS OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF ORDINARY SHARES, AND IT MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME AT THE COMPANY\\u2019S DISCRETION. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS FUNDED USING THE COMPANY\\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND ANY REPURCHASED SHARES ARE RECORDED AS AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES. THERE WERE NO SHARES REPURCHASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, $50.0 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASES THROUGH JUNE 30, 2020.  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR PERFORMANCE  ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON COMPUTER VISION TRENDS  . WE EXPECT THAT COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITY WILL BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT IN MANY OF OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE MARKETS, INCLUDING  IP SECURITY,  AUTOMOTIVE, ROBOTICS, AND UAV MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADVANCED AI COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY, ENABLE AND SUPPORT CUSTOMER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN EMERGING APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ADAS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, PEOPLE RECOGNITION, RETAIL ANALYTICS, AND MACHINE LEARNING, AND GAIN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND SOLUTIONS, WILL BE CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE SUCCESS. MOREOVER, ACHIEVING DESIGN WINS, PARTICULARLY FOR COMPUTER VISION-CENTRIC APPLICATIONS IN THE  IP SECURITY,  AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, IS VITAL TO OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE GROWTH. AS SUCH, WE CLOSELY MONITOR DESIGN WINS BY CUSTOMER AND END MARKET. HOWEVER, A DESIGN WIN MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY MATERIALIZE INTO REVENUE, AND EVEN IF IT DOES RESULT IN REVENUE, THE AMOUNT GENERATED BY EACH DESIGN WIN CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY.  26  PRICING, PRODUCT COST AND MARGIN  . OUR PRICING AND MARGINS DEPEND ON THE VOLUMES AND FEATURES OF THE SOLUTIONS WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW SOLUTIO  NS FOR BOTH COST IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES THAT WE EXPECT TO DRIVE REVENUE AND MAINTAIN MARGINS. IN GENERAL, SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED INTO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAMERA APPLICATIONS OR, IN THE FUTURE, ADVANCED  DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS, HAVE HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AS COMPARED TO SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO LOWER-PERFORMING, MORE COMPETITIVE CAMERA APPLICATIONS. OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICE CAN VARY BY MARKET AND APPLICATION DUE TO MARKET-SPECIFIC SUPPLY AN  D DEMAND, THE MATURATION OF PRODUCTS LAUNCHED IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS.  WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE COST OF OUR SOLUTIONS. AS WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAINTAIN A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR PRODUCTION YIELDS, COMPONENT COSTS AND DESIGN EFFICIENCIES.  SHIFTING CONSUMER PREFERENCES.  OUR REVENUE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONSUMER PREFERENCES, REGARDING FORM FACTOR AND FUNCTIONALITY, AND HOW THOSE PREFERENCES IMPACT THE VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE ELECTRONICS THAT WE SUPPORT. FOR EXAMPLE, IMPROVED SMARTPHONE VIDEO CAPTURE CAPABILITIES LED TO THE DECLINE OF VIDEO CAMERAS AIMED AT THE VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE MARKET. THE CURRENT VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE MARKET IS NOW CHARACTERIZED BY A GREATER VOLUME OF MORE SPECIALIZED VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE REPLACED WITH SMARTPHONES, SUCH AS WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE CAMERAS. THIS INCREASING SPECIALIZATION OF VIDEO CAPTURE DEVICES HAS CHANGED OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND END MARKETS AND HAS IMPACTED OUR REVENUE. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT FURTHER CHANGES WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN THOSE MARKETS.  CONTINUED CONCENTRATION OF REVENUE BY END MARKET  . HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF END MARKETS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2010, THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE CAME FROM THE POCKET VIDEO, CAMCORDER AND INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS. SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR NEW MARKETS AS THEY EMERGED, SUCH AS THE WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER CAMERA MARKETS. SINCE FISCAL YEAR 2013, THE WEARABLE SPORTS, PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY AND UAV MARKETS HAVE BEEN OUR LARGEST END MARKETS AND SALES INTO THESE MARKETS COLLECTIVELY GENERATED THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EXPANSION INTO NEW MARKETS IS REQUIRED TO FACILITATE REVENUE GROWTH AND CUSTOMER DIVERSIFICATION AS OUR REVENUE FROM THE WEARABLE CAMERA AND UAV CAMERA MARKETS HAS DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS EMERGING APPLICATIONS AND MARKETS, SUCH AS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITIES FOR AI-ENABLED SECURITY CAMERAS, AI-BASED DRIVING APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-PARKING, DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEMS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR HD MAPPING SOLUTIONS, OEM AUTOMOTIVE ADAS APPLICATIONS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS. WHILE WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO EXPAND OUR END MARKET EXPOSURE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF END MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR END MARKET CONCENTRATION MAY CAUSE OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF PRODUCTS THAT OUR SOCS ARE DESIGNED INTO AS WELL AS THE OVERALL GROWTH OR DECLINE IN THE VIDEO CAPTURE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF ODMS WHO BUILD PRODUCTS ON BEHALF OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEMS AND FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEMS TO WHOM WE SHIP DIRECTLY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON SALES TO A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS.  ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON CONNECTIVITY TRENDS  . MOBILE CONNECTED DEVICES ARE UBIQUITOUS TODAY AND PLAY AN INCREASINGLY PROMINENT ROLE IN CONSUMERS\\u2019 LIVES. THE CONSTANT CONNECTIVITY PROVIDED BY THESE DEVICES HAS CREATED A DEMAND FOR CONNECTED ELECTRONIC PERIPHERALS SUCH AS VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES. OUR ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE TRENDS BY SUPPORTING OUR END CUSTOMERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTED PERIPHERALS THAT SEAMLESSLY COOPERATE WITH OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES AND ALLOW CONSUMERS TO DISTRIBUTE AND SHARE VIDEO AND IMAGES WITH ONLINE MEDIA PLATFORMS IS CRITICAL FOR OUR SUCCESS. WE HAVE ADDED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONALITY INTO OUR SOLUTIONS FOR WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER CAMERAS. THE COMBINATION OF OUR COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY WITH WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY ENABLES WIRELESS VIDEO STREAMING AND UPLOADING OF VIDEOS AND IMAGES TO THE INTERNET. OUR SOLUTIONS ENABLE IP SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEMS TO STREAM VIDEO CONTENT TO EITHER CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE OR CONNECTED MOBILE DEVICES, AND OUR SOLUTIONS FOR WEARABLE AND UAV CAMERAS ALLOW CONSUMERS TO QUICKLY STREAM OR UPLOAD VIDEO AND IMAGES TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.  SALES VOLUME  . A TYPICAL DESIGN WIN THAT SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES INTO THE MARKETPLACE CAN GENERATE A WIDE RANGE OF SALES VOLUMES FOR OUR SOLUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE END MARKET DEMAND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 PRODUCTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY FORECAST DEMAND CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE REPUTATION OF THE END CUSTOMER, MARKET PENETRATION, PRODUCT CAPABILITIES, SIZE OF THE END MARKET THAT THE PRODUCT ADDRESSES, OUR END CUSTOMERS\\u2019 ABILITY TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS, MISCALCULATIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS OF THEIR INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR PRODUCT ORDER MIX AND FLUCTUATING DEMAND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 PRODUCTS. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE MAY PROVIDE VOLUME DISCOUNTS ON SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS, WHICH MAY BE OFFSET BY LOWER MANUFACTURING COSTS RELATED TO HIGHER VOLUMES. IN GENERAL, OUR CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER MARKET PENETRATION AND BETTER BRANDING TEND TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LARGER VOLUMES OVER THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE.  27  CUSTOMER PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE.  WE ESTIMATE OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES BASED ON THE CUSTOMER, TYPE  OF PRODUCT AND END MARKET. WE TYPICALLY COMMENCE COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS FROM SIX TO 18 MONTHS FOLLOWING A DESIGN WIN; HOWEVER, IN SOME MARKETS, MORE LENGTHY PRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLES ARE POSSIBLE, DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE PROJECT, SUCH  AS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM MARKET. A PORTABLE CONSUMER DEVICE TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF SIX TO 18 MONTHS, AND AN IP SECURITY CAMERA TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 12 TO 24 MONTHS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT LIFE CYC  LES WILL TYPICALLY BE LONGER THAN 24 MONTHS IN THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE, TIER-1 AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS TYPICALLY OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THESE MARKETS.

IN RECENT YEARS, OUR SOC SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY USED IN CAMERA MARKETS, SUCH AS IP SECURITY, AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER, DRONE AND WEARABLE CAMERAS. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THESE CAMERA MARKETS, IN PARTICULAR THE IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED NEW SOCS TARGETING EMERGING COMPUTER VISION APPLICATIONS IN THE IP SECURITY, OEM AUTOMOTIVE, AND ROBOTICS MARKETS. WE DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM SALES MADE INDIRECTLY THROUGH ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WINTECH MICROELECTRONICS CO., LTD., OR WINTECH, AND DIRECTLY TO ONE OF OUR ODM CUSTOMERS, CHICONY ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., OR CHICONY.  28  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY REVENUE WITH OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER NORMALLY BEING THE HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER. THIS FLUCTUATION HAS BEEN DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED SALES IN I  P SECURITY AND CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS AS OUR CUSTOMERS BUILD INVENTORIES IN PREPARATION FOR THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON. DUE TO  EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR OUR SOLUTIONS IN SEVERAL CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS, INCLUDING WEARABLE CAMERA, VIRTUAL REALITY  AND DRONE MARKETS  , THE SEASONAL IMPACT ON QUARTERLY REVENUE MAY NOT BE AS SIGNIFICANT AS IN PRIOR YEARS. MORE GENERALLY, OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE MIX OF OUR SOLUTIONS SOLD IN A PERIOD WHICH REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF BOTH CHANGES IN U  NIT SALES OF EXISTING SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION AND SALES OF NEW SOLUTIONS. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE TYPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY A LIFE CYCLE THAT BEGINS WITH HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER VOLUMES, FOLLOWED BY BROADER MARKET ADOPTION, HIGHER  VOLUMES AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAT ARE LOWER THAN INITIAL LEVELS.  THE END MARKETS INTO WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AS CONSUMER PREFERENCES HAVE EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPOSITION AND TIMING OF OUR REVENUE MAY DIFFER MEANINGFULLY DURING PERIODS OF TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCE CHANGES. WE EXPECT SHIFTS IN CONSUMER USE OF VIDEO CAPTURE TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AS COMPUTER VISION SPECIALIZED USE CASES EMERGE AND VIDEO CAPTURE CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE.  COST OF REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN  COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES THE COST OF MATERIALS SUCH AS WAFERS PROCESSED BY THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PACKAGING, ASSEMBLY AND TESTING, AND OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPORT OPERATIONS SUCH AS LOGISTICS, PLANNING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. COST OF REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES INDIRECT COSTS SUCH AS WARRANTY, INVENTORY VALUATION RESERVES AND OTHER GENERAL OVERHEAD COSTS.  WE EXPECT THAT OUR GROSS MARGIN MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, PRODUCT MIX AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED INTO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAMERAS, AND IN FUTURE ADVANCED AUTOMOTIVE OEM APPLICATIONS, HAVE HAD OR ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS, AS COMPARED TO SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO THE LOWER-PERFORMANCE, MORE COMPETITIVE CAMERA APPLICATIONS. AS SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS MATURE AND UNIT VOLUMES SOLD TO CUSTOMERS INCREASE, THEIR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES TYPICALLY DECLINE. THESE DECLINES MAY BE PAIRED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN MANUFACTURING YIELDS AND LOWER WAFER, PACKAGING AND TEST COSTS, WHICH OFFSET SOME OF THE MARGIN REDUCTION THAT COULD RESULT FROM LOWER SELLING PRICES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GROSS MARGIN WILL DECLINE IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO PENETRATE THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CAMERA MARKET AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE IP SECURITY MARKET.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS, INCLUDING SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH OUR FOUNDRY VENDORS, COSTS OF LICENSING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THIRD PARTIES FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT FOR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TOOLS, COST OF FABRICATION OF MASK SETS FOR PROTOTYPE PRODUCTS, AND ALLOCATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY EXPENSES, NET OF ANY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND OUR PRODUCT FEATURES AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASE HEADCOUNT FOR NEW SOC DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE MARKET.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS, INCLUDING SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FOR OUR SALES, MARKETING, FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. THE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES PROFESSIONAL SERVICE COSTS RELATED TO ACCOUNTING, TAX, LEGAL SERVICES, AND ALLOCATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY EXPENSES. WE EXPECT OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPAND THE SIZE OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OF ADDRESSING NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH OUR COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY.  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME, NET, CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME FROM DEBT SECURITY INVESTMENTS AND CASH DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  29  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  WE ARE INCORPORATED AND DOMICILED IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND ALSO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES, CHINA, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, ITALY, SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN, AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME IS SUBJECT TO VARYING TAX RATES, AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR EARNINGS OR LOSSES AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN EACH GEOGRAPHICAL REGION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION FROM CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; TAX BENEFITS FROM EXCESS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS; TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE TAX EFFECTS OF NONDEDUCTIBLE COMPENSATION. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AS A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS. IF OUR OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE WAS TO CHANGE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OPERATING INCOME SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN HIGHER-TAX JURISDICTIONS, OR IF WE WERE TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS ASSESSING RELATIVELY HIGHER TAX RATES, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND/OR BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR RESERVES ARE REASONABLE, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND ACCRUALS. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION RESERVES AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN DETERMINING ANY VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING PAST OPERATING RESULTS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. IN THE EVENT THAT WE CHANGE OUR DETERMINATION AS TO THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT CAN BE REALIZED, WE WILL ADJUST OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE WITH A CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

THE DECREASES WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRINCIPALLY THE VIDEO RECORDER MARKET, CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM A LARGE AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASED REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED REVENUE IN THE CONSUMER IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, LED BY HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING MARKET IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION.  IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE CHINA AND EUROPE REGIONS, AND INITIAL RAMPS OF OUR COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOLUTIONS IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. IN THE SPORTS CAMERA MARKET, INCORPORATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS INTO NEWLY LAUNCHED SPORTS CAMERA PRODUCTS FROM DAJIANG INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INC., OR DJI, PARTIALLY OFFSET REVENUE LOSS FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO GOPRO, INC.

THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF SOCS FOR THE IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKETS.  30  GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREA  SE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE THAT WAS DERIVED FROM THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKETS COMBINED WITH THE DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM THE HIGHER GROSS MARGIN SPORTS CAMERA, DRONE AND AUTOMOTIVE OEM MARKETS  . THE DECREASED GROSS MARGIN  WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO RISING TARIFFS THAT HAD GREAT IMPACT ON OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 ABILITY TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS INCORPORATING OUR HIGHER GROSS MARGIN DEVICES AND INCREASED COSTS TO ACCELERATE ORDERS AS A RESULT OF INCREASED GEOPOLITICAL CHALLENGES FROM OUR  SUPPLY-CHAIN.

THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALARY-RELATED AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED HEADCOUNT, ISSUANCE OF STOCK AND BONUS PROGRAM.  OUR ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT INCREASED TO 559 AT JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 547 AT JULY 31, 2018. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, SALARY-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE SOC DEVELOPMENT COST WAS RELATIVELY FLAT FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO THE TIMING AND NUMBER OF CHIPS IN DEVELOPMENT.

THE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LARGER INVESTED BALANCES, HIGHER INTEREST RATE AND DEBT SECURITIES PURCHASED AT DISCOUNTS.  31  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  CHANGE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  CHANGE  2019  2018  AMOUNT%  2019  2018  AMOUNT%  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  $1,978  $927  $1,051  113.4%  $3,244  $1,775  $1,469  82.8%  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  (24.1)%  (15.6)%  \\u2014  (8.5)%  (13.4)%  (11.7)%  \\u2014  (1.7)%  THE QUARTERLY INCOME TAXES REFLECT AN ESTIMATE OF THE CORRESPONDING FISCAL YEAR\\u2019S ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND INCLUDE, WHEN APPLICABLE, ADJUSTMENTS FROM DISCRETE TAX ITEMS ARISING IN THAT QUARTER.  THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NON-DEDUCTIBLE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF PROFITS GENERATED IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS AND LOSSES INCURRED IN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY WAS NOT ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A RELATED TAX BENEFIT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND JANUARY 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $375.8 MILLION AND $358.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  WE INVEST IN HIGHLY LIQUID, SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AND HOLD THESE INVESTMENTS AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, THESE SECURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $208.3 MILLION WITH INSIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED LOSSES CAUSED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUE.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $13,419  $6,977  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  11,871  5,254  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  3,354  (63,614  )  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  $28,644  $(51,383  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES AS A RESULT OF DECREASED REVENUE AND INCREASED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LARGER NET LOSS, INCREASED NON-CASH EXPENSES, DECREASED CASH RECEIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND INCREASED PURCHASES OF OTHER ASSETS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN ADDITIONAL $57.1 MILLION IN CASH RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE AND MATURITY OF DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $51.5 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION SMALLER EXPENDITURE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.  32  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO $65.6 MILLION OF CASH USED FOR THE REPURCHASING OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 THAT WAS NOT INCURRED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CASH PROCEEDS FROM OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE WITHHOLDING. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION IN CASH FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS PURCHASED IN FISCAL YEAR 2020.  OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $375.8 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE AS WE INCREASE HEADCOUNT, EXPAND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AND IMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. AS WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY REQUIRE MORE WORKING CAPITAL. IF OUR AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY SEEK TO SELL EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR BORROW FUNDS COMMERCIALLY. THE SALE OF EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES MAY RESULT IN DILUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND THOSE SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, THESE SECURITIES COULD CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BEYOND OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED AMOUNTS. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON REASONABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL.  OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \\u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS;  \\u2022  OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR COSTS;  \\u2022  THE EXPANSION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS;  \\u2022  THE EMERGENCE OF COMPETING OR COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS;  \\u2022  THE COSTS OF FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING ANY PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PARTICIPATING IN LITIGATION-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND  \\u2022  OUR ACQUISITION OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  MANUFACTURING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OF $41.3 MILLION.  LEASES  THE COMPANY ADOPTED  ASC 842, LEASES  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019. AS A RESULT, THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS ARE REFLECTED ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS LEASE LIABILITIES AS OF JULY 31, 2019.

SEE  \\u201cSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\u201d AT  THE BEGINNING OF PART I, ITEM 1.  OVERVIEW  WE  MANUFACTURE AND SELL A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF INDUSTRIAL PROTECTIVE  CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES FOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTIVE  CLOTHING MARKET. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD GLOBALLY BY OUR IN-HOUSE  SALES TEAMS, OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE GROUP, AND AUTHORIZED INDEPENDENT  SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO A NETWORK OF OVER 1,600 GLOBAL SAFETY  AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY DISTRIBUTORS. OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS  SUPPLY END USERS, SUCH AS INTEGRATED OIL, CHEMICAL/PETROCHEMICAL,  AUTOMOBILE, STEEL, GLASS, CONSTRUCTION, SMELTING, HEAVY AND LIGHT  INDUSTRY, CLEANROOM, JANITORIAL, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND HIGH  TECHNOLOGY ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC,  MEDICAL LABORATORIES AND THE UTILITIES INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, WE  SUPPLY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND  DEPARTMENTS, SUCH AS FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, AIRPORT CRASH RESCUE  UNITS, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND  SECURITY AND THE US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. INTERNATIONALLY,  WE SELL TO A MIXTURE OF END USERS DIRECTLY, AND TO INDUSTRIAL  DISTRIBUTORS DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND MARKET. SALES  ARE MADE TO MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE INTO  CHINA, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (\\u201cEEC\\u201d), CANADA,  CHILE, ARGENTINA, RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, ECUADOR,  INDIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA.  WE HAVE  OPERATED FACILITIES IN MEXICO SINCE 1995 AND IN CHINA SINCE 1996.  BEGINNING IN 1995, WE MOVED THE LABOR INTENSIVE SEWING OPERATION  FOR OUR LIMITED USE/DISPOSABLE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING LINES TO THESE  FACILITIES. OUR FACILITIES AND CAPABILITIES IN CHINA AND MEXICO  ALLOW ACCESS TO A LESS EXPENSIVE LABOR POOL THAN IS AVAILABLE IN  THE UNITED STATES AND PERMIT US TO PURCHASE CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS  AT A LOWER COST THAN THEY ARE AVAILABLE DOMESTICALLY. MORE RECENTLY  WE HAVE INITIATED STARTUP MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM AND  INDIA TO OFFSET INCREASING MANUFACTURING COSTS IN CHINA. THIS SHIFT  IN MANUFACTURING, AND THE REDUNDANT MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY IT  PROVIDES, ALSO SERVES TO INSULATE THE COMPANY FROM THE COST  IMPLICATIONS OF BILATERAL TRADE DISPUTES. OUR CHINA OPERATIONS WILL  CONTINUE OPERATIONS PRIMARILY MANUFACTURING FOR THE CHINESE MARKET  AND OTHER MARKETS WHERE DUTY ADVANTAGES EXIST. MANUFACTURING  EXPANSION IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY TO CONTROL RISING COSTS, IT IS ALSO  NECESSARY FOR LAKELAND TO ACHIEVE ITS GROWTH OBJECTIVES. OUR NET  SALES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE  $13.0 MILLION AND $12.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018 AND $24.9 AND $24.3 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES  GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES US TO MAKE  ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,  LIABILITIES, NET SALES AND EXPENSES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON THE PAST  EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE  REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE  THESE ESTIMATES.  WE  BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT OUR MORE  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR  UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL  OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM PRODUCT SALES, WHICH  CONSIST OF SALES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PERSONAL PROTECTIVE WEAR  PRODUCTS TO DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS PURCHASE ORDERS TO  BE A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER. CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS ARE  CONSIDERED TO BE SHORT-TERM WHEN THE TIME BETWEEN ORDER  CONFIRMATION AND SATISFACTION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IS  EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN ONE YEAR, AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE  COMPANY\\u2019S CONTRACTS ARE SHORT-TERM. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES  REVENUE FOR THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS TO CUSTOMERS IN AN  AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS  TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY  SATISFIES ITS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  UPON SHIPMENT OF THE GOODS. GENERALLY, PAYMENT IS DUE FROM  CUSTOMERS WITHIN 30 TO 90 DAYS OF THE INVOICE DATE, AND THE  CONTRACTS DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY  ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITIES AS A  FULFILLMENT COST RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTBOUND FREIGHT ARE  INCLUDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018 AND WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION AND $0.8 MILLION,  RESPECTIVELY, AND FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018  WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS RELATING TO PRODUCT SALES AND  REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM  REVENUE.  29  THE  TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION  RELATED TO REBATES, ALLOWANCES, AND DISCOUNTS THAT ARE REDUCTIONS  IN REVENUE. ALL ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL  EXPERIENCE, ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANY'S BEST  JUDGMENT AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. ESTIMATES FOR VARIABLE  CONSIDERATION ARE REASSESSED EACH REPORTING PERIOD AND ARE INCLUDED  IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A  SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT  OCCUR UPON RESOLUTION OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLE  CONSIDERATION. ALL THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONTRACTS HAVE A SINGLE  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME AND THE  TRANSACTION PRICE IS STATED IN THE CONTRACT, USUALLY AS QUANTITY  TIME\\u2019S PRICE PER UNIT.  THE  COMPANY HAS SEVEN REVENUE GENERATING REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS  UNDER ASC TOPIC 280 \\u201cSEGMENT REPORTING\\u201d AND DERIVES ITS  SALES PRIMARILY FROM ITS LIMITED USE/DISPOSABLE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING  AND SECONDARILY FROM ITS SALES OF REFLECTIVE CLOTHING, HIGH-END  CHEMICAL PROTECTIVE SUITS, FIREFIGHTING AND HEAT PROTECTIVE  APPAREL, REUSABLE WOVEN GARMENTS AND GLOVES AND ARM GUARDS. THE  COMPANY BELIEVES DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION  BEST DEPICTS THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF ITS  REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS (SEE TABLE BELOW). NET SALES BY GEOGRAPHIC  REGION AND BY PRODUCT LINE ARE INCLUDED BELOW.

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE  STATED AT THE AMOUNT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COLLECT. THE COMPANY  MAINTAINS ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES  RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF ITS CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED  PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES LOSSES WHEN INFORMATION AVAILABLE  INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A RECEIVABLE HAS BEEN IMPAIRED  BASED ON CRITERIA NOTED BELOW AT THE DATE OF THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE  LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE  FOLLOWING FACTORS WHEN DETERMINING THE COLLECTABILITY OF SPECIFIC  CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS: CUSTOMER CREDITWORTHINESS, PAST TRANSACTION  HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC INDUSTRY TRENDS AND  CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PAYMENT TERMS. PAST DUE BALANCES OVER 90 DAYS  AND OTHER LESS CREDITWORTHY ACCOUNTS ARE REVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY FOR  COLLECTABILITY. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO  MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES WOULD BE REQUIRED. BASED ON  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR ESTIMATED  UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS THROUGH A CHARGE TO EARNINGS AND A CREDIT TO  A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. BALANCES THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING AFTER THE  COMPANY HAS USED REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS ARE WRITTEN OFF  THROUGH A CHARGE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND A CREDIT TO  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  30  INVENTORIES.  INVENTORIES INCLUDE FREIGHT-IN, MATERIALS,  LABOR AND OVERHEAD COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (ON A  FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS) OR NET REALIZED VALUE.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE  CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS  OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE  RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY MEASURES ANY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT ON A  PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD. ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH  FLOWS REQUIRES THE COMPANY\\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE PROJECTIONS  THAT CAN DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THE CARRYING VALUE  OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE TOTAL  PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS  CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE  AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  LONG-LIVED ASSET.  INCOME TAXES.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE ITS INCOME  TAXES IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES AS PART OF  PREPARING THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS. THIS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE ACTUAL CURRENT TAX IN  ADDITION TO ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM  DIFFERING TREATMENTS FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.  THESE DIFFERENCES, TOGETHER WITH NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS  AND TAX CREDITS, ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE  SHEET. A JUDGMENT MUST THEN BE MADE OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ANY  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. A  VALUATION ALLOWANCE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. IN THE  EVENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL  OR PART OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET IN THE FUTURE, OR THAT NEW  ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT A PREVIOUSLY RECORDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE  IS NO LONGER REQUIRED, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS  CHARGED OR CREDITED TO INCOME IN THE PERIOD OF SUCH  DETERMINATION.  THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX POSITIONS THAT MEET A \\u201cMORE LIKELY  THAN NOT\\u201d MINIMUM RECOGNITION THRESHOLD. IF NECESSARY, THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX  MATTERS AS PART OF THE INCOME TAX PROVISION AND WOULD INCLUDE  ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES WITH THE RELATED TAX LIABILITY IN  THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY  DOES NOT HAVE ANY UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AT JULY 31, 2019 OR  JANUARY 31, 2019.  FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  . THE  COMPANY MAINTAINS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN THE PEOPLE\\u2019S  REPUBLIC OF CHINA, MEXICO, VIETNAM, INDIA, AND ARGENTINA AND CAN  ACCESS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CHINA, VIETNAM, ARGENTINA, AND  MEXICO. IT ALSO MAINTAINS SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ENTITIES LOCATED  IN CHINA, CANADA, THE U.K., CHILE, ARGENTINA, RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN,  INDIA, MEXICO, URUGUAY, AUSTRALIA, AND VIETNAM. THE COMPANY IS  VULNERABLE TO CURRENCY RISKS IN THESE COUNTRIES. THE FUNCTIONAL  CURRENCY FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM SUBSIDIARY IS THE EURO; THE TRADING  COMPANY IN CHINA, THE RMB; AND THE RUSSIAN OPERATION, THE RUSSIAN  RUBLE, AND THE KAZAKHSTAN OPERATION THE KAZAKHSTAN TENGE. ALL OTHER  OPERATIONS HAVE THE US DOLLAR AS ITS FUNCTIONAL  CURRENCY.  PURSUANT  TO US GAAP, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S FOREIGN  OPERATIONS WITH FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE US DOLLAR, ARE  TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE IN EFFECT AT THE BALANCE SHEET  DATE, WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES  PREVAILING DURING THE PERIODS. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED  IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS, A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF  STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY. CASH FLOWS ARE ALSO TRANSLATED AT  AVERAGE TRANSLATION RATES FOR THE PERIODS, THEREFORE AMOUNTS  REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS WILL NOT  NECESSARILY AGREE WITH CHANGES IN THE CORRESPONDING BALANCES ON THE  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE  FROM EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN A  CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN THE  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  US GAAP DEFINES FAIR  VALUE, PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND REQUIRES  CERTAIN DISCLOSURES UTILIZING A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH IS  CATEGORIZED INTO THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION  TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF  DESCRIPTION OF THOSE THREE LEVELS.  31  LEVEL  1.  OBSERVABLE INPUTS  SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL  ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL  2.  INPUTS OTHER THAN  QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY,  EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THESE INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR  SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND QUOTED PRICES  FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE  NOT ACTIVE.  LEVEL  3.  UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS  THAT REFLECT MANAGEMENT\\u2019S OWN ASSUMPTIONS.  THE  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS  OR LIABILITIES, INCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE, SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, BORROWINGS UNDER REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, ARE  RECORDED AT CARRYING VALUE, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON  THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.  THE  COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FAIR VALUES OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT  APPROXIMATES ITS CARRYING VALUE BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST  RATE COMPARED TO THE CURRENT MARKET RATE AVAILABLE TO THE  COMPANY.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE  NOTE 3 IN THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S PERIODIC REVIEW OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  THAT WERE ISSUED.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED $1.5 MILLION AND INVENTORY  INCREASED BY $7.0 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019.  THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN  SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN  INVENTORY WAS DUE TO THE SCALE UP OF OUR VIETNAM OPERATIONS; RAW  MATERIALS AND FINISHED GOODS (\\\"FG\\\") TO CATCH UP ON REMAINING  GLOVES, FIRE, AND HIGH VISABILITY ORDERS DELAYED DUE TO OUR ERP  INSTALLATION AND RAW MATERIALS AND FG REQUIRED TO RAMP UP PRODUCT  OF OUR NEW, HIGH VALUE UTILITIES PRODUCT LINE AT A MAJOR  DISTRIBUTOR. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED COMPENSATION, AND OTHER  ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED $3.4 MILLION DUE TO INCREASED INVENTORY  AND INCREASED COMPENSATION ACCRUALS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF PAY  DATES AND SEVERANCE.

SALES IN THE US WERE UP $1.1 MILLION OR 8.1%  PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED CUSTOMER DELIVERIES ENABLING US TO REDUCE  HIGH ORDER BACKLOGS. NO OTHER REGION HAD A MATERIAL CHANGE DURING  THE PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS  PROFIT INCREASED $1.3 MILLION, OR 13.9%, TO $10.4 MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, FROM $9.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.

OPERATING  EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 28.3% FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, FROM 29.3% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED LEGAL AND  PROFESSIONAL FEES, COMPENSATION (INCLUDING SEVERANCE), AND  DEPRECIATION, OFFSET BY DECREASES IN BAD DEBT EXPENSES, AND  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED  PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCED NUMBER OF SHARES EXPECTED TO BE EARNED  UNDER THE PERFORMANCE PLAN.  32  OPERATING PROFIT  .

GROSS  PROFITS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WERE ADVERSELY  EFFECTED BY INEFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE PERIOD  DUE TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S RECENT CONVERSION TO AN ERP SOFTWARE  SYSTEM. THOSE INEFFICIENCIES RESULTED IN INCREASED FREIGHT AND  LABOR EXPENSES REQUIRED TO EXPEDITE SHIPMENTS OF MATERIALS AND  CUSTOMER ORDERS. WHILE MANY OF THESE ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM  IMPLEMENTATION HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND THE COMPANY BEGAN TO REALIZE  THE RESULTING BENEFITS IN THE LAST PART OF THE PERIOD, REMEDIATION  ACTIVITIES ARE CONTINUING AND WE EXPECT SUCH ADVERSE EFFECTS TO  CONTINUE LESSENING, AND ULTIMATELY YIELD IMPROVED FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED 7.2% TO  $15.7 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 FROM $14.6  MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.

FACILITIES MAINTENANCE DISTRIBUTES MRO PRODUCTS, PROVIDES VALUE-ADD SERVICES AND FABRICATES CUSTOM PRODUCTS. THE INDUSTRIES THAT FACILITIES MAINTENANCE SERVES INCLUDE MULTIFAMILY, HOSPITALITY, HEALTHCARE AND INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES.

ELIMINATIONS INCLUDE THE ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.  \\u200b  ACQUISITIONS  \\u200b  WE ENTER INTO STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS FROM TIME TO TIME TO EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS, NEW PLATFORMS, AND NEW GEOGRAPHIES IN AN EFFORT TO BETTER SERVICE EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACT NEW ONES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\\u201cASC\\u201d) 805, \\u201cBUSINESS COMBINATIONS,\\u201d THE RESULTS OF THE ACQUISITIONS WE COMPLETED ARE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION FORWARD.  \\u200b  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  HD SUPPLY  \\u200b  ON MARCH 5, 2018, OUR CONSTRUCTION & INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS ACQUIRED A.H. HARRIS CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES (\\u201cA.H. HARRIS\\u201d) FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $359 MILLION IN CASH, ADJUSTED FOR THE FINAL WORKING CAPITAL SETTLEMENT RECEIVED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER 2019\\u201d). A.H. HARRIS IS A LEADING SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTOR SERVING THE NORTHEAST AND MID-ATLANTIC REGIONS. THIS ACQUISITION EXPANDS CONSTRUCTION & INDUSTRIAL\\u2019S MARKET PRESENCE IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF A.H. HARRIS, SEE \\u201cNOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS,\\u201d IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITHIN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  \\u200b  SEASONALITY  \\u200b  IN A TYPICAL YEAR, OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY SEASONALITY. HISTORICALLY, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR DUE TO FAVORABLE WEATHER AND LONGER DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS DURING THESE PERIODS. SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS MAY ALSO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS, SUCH AS COLD OR WET WEATHER, WHICH CAN DELAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.  \\u200b  FISCAL YEAR  \\u200b  HD SUPPLY\\u2019S FISCAL YEAR IS A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SUNDAY NEAREST TO JANUARY 31.  THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 2, 2020 (\\u201cFISCAL 2019\\u201d) INCLUDES 52 WEEKS AND THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2019 (\\u201cFISCAL 2018\\u201d) INCLUDED 53 WEEKS.  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER 2019\\u201d) AND JULY 29, 2018 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER 2018\\u201d) BOTH INCLUDE 13 WEEKS. THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 AND JULY 29, 2018 BOTH INCLUDE 26 WEEKS.  KEY BUSINESS METRICS  \\u200b  NET SALES  \\u200b  WE EARN OUR NET SALES PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OPERATIONS, AND RENOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT-RELATED PRODUCTS AND OUR PROVISION OF RELATED SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY 500,000 CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CONTRACTORS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS, HOME BUILDERS AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. WE RECOGNIZE SALES, NET OF SALES TAX AND ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS AND DISCOUNTS, WHEN AN IDENTIFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED BY TRANSFER OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER. NET SALES IN CERTAIN BUSINESS UNITS FLUCTUATE WITH THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES AS WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITIES PRICES BY PASSING SUCH INCREASES IN THE PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY-BASED PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  \\u200b  WE SHIP PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS BY INTERNAL FLEET AND BY THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS. NET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED FROM PRODUCT SALES WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH GENERALLY OCCURS AT THE POINT OF DESTINATION.  \\u200b  WE INCLUDE SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN NET SALES. SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INBOUND FREIGHT ARE CAPITALIZED TO INVENTORIES AND RELIEVED THROUGH COST OF SALES AS INVENTORIES ARE SOLD. WE ACCOUNT FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTBOUND FREIGHT AS A FULFILLMENT COST. SUCH COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  \\u200b  GROSS PROFIT  \\u200b  GROSS PROFIT PRIMARILY REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRODUCT COST FROM OUR SUPPLIERS (NET OF EARNED REBATES AND DISCOUNTS), INCLUDING THE COST OF INBOUND FREIGHT, AND THE SALE PRICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THE COST OF OUTBOUND FREIGHT, PURCHASING, RECEIVING AND WAREHOUSING ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WITHIN OPERATING EXPENSES. OUR GROSS PROFIT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER COMPANIES, AS OTHER COMPANIES MAY INCLUDE ALL OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS IN COST OF SALES.  \\u200b  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  HD SUPPLY  \\u200b  OPERATING EXPENSES  \\u200b  OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE PAYROLL EXPENSES (SALARIES, WAGES, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, PAYROLL TAXES AND BONUSES), OUTBOUND FREIGHT, RENT, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE AND PROFESSIONAL FEES. IN ADDITION, OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME  \\u200b  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME ARE NOT RECOGNIZED TERMS UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) AND DO NOT PURPORT TO BE ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE PRESENT ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME BECAUSE EACH IS A PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT ADJUSTED NET INCOME TO MEASURE OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY AS WE BELIEVE IT IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME ENHANCES OUR INVESTORS\\u2019 OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME ARE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING OPERATING TRENDS, BECAUSE EACH EXCLUDES THE RESULTS OF DECISIONS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF OPERATING MANAGEMENT AND THAT CAN DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM COMPANY TO COMPANY DEPENDING ON LONG-TERM STRATEGIC DECISIONS REGARDING CAPITAL STRUCTURE, THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH COMPANIES OPERATE, AGE AND BOOK DEPRECIATION OF FACILITIES AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  \\u200b  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS BASED ON \\u2018\\u2018CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,\\u2019\\u2019 A MEASURE WHICH IS DEFINED IN OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES AND USED IN CALCULATING FINANCIAL RATIOS IN SEVERAL MATERIAL DEBT COVENANTS. BORROWINGS UNDER THESE FACILITIES ARE A KEY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY AND OUR ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THESE FACILITIES DEPENDS UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH FINANCIAL RATIO COVENANTS. IN PARTICULAR, BOTH FACILITIES CONTAIN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT CAN RESTRICT OUR ACTIVITIES IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN FINANCIAL RATIOS CALCULATED BASED ON CONSOLIDATED EBITDA. OUR SENIOR ABL FACILITY REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1:1 IF OUR SPECIFIED EXCESS AVAILABILITY (INCLUDING AN AMOUNT BY WHICH OUR BORROWING BASE EXCEEDS THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS) UNDER THE SENIOR ABL FACILITY FALLS BELOW THE GREATER OF $100 MILLION AND 10% OF THE LESSER OF (A) THE BORROWING BASE AND (B) THE TOTAL FACILITY COMMITMENT (BOTH AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR ABL FACILITY AGREEMENT). ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) LESS INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, PLUS (I) INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME, NET, (II) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, (III) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND FURTHER ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, NON-CASH ITEMS AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL STRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS PERMITTED IN CALCULATING CONSOLIDATED EBITDA UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING ADJUSTED EBITDA IS APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT HOW THE COVENANTS IN THOSE AGREEMENTS OPERATE AND ABOUT CERTAIN NON-CASH AND OTHER ITEMS. THE TERM LOAN FACILITY AND SENIOR ABL FACILITY PERMIT US TO MAKE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN CALCULATING CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, SUCH AS PROJECTED NET COST SAVINGS, WHICH ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ADJUSTED EBITDA DATA PRESENTED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.

OUR BUSINESS IS FULLY INTEGRATED ACROSS OUR MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION, CONSISTING OF OUR STORES, SOURCE BOOKS AND WEBSITES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \\u200b  AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, WE OPERATED THE FOLLOWING NUMBER OF RETAIL GALLERIES, OUTLETS AND SHOWROOMS.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  RH  \\u200b  \\u200b  DESIGN GALLERIES  20  LEGACY GALLERIES  \\u200b  43  MODERN GALLERIES  \\u200b  2  BABY & CHILD GALLERIES  \\u200b  5  TOTAL RH GALLERIES  \\u200b  70  OUTLETS  \\u200b  40  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  WATERWORKS SHOWROOMS  \\u200b  15  \\u200b  AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, SIX OF OUR RH DESIGN GALLERIES INCLUDE AN INTEGRATED RH HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE AND WE PLAN TO INCORPORATE HOSPITALITY, INCLUDING CAFE\\u0301S, WINE VAULTS AND BARISTA BARS IN MANY OF THE NEW GALLERIES THAT WE OPEN IN THE FUTURE.  KEY VALUE DRIVING STRATEGIES  IN ORDER TO DRIVE GROWTH ACROSS OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM KEY STRATEGIES.  \\u25cf  TRANSFORM OUR REAL ESTATE PLATFORM.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR SALES BY TRANSFORMING OUR REAL ESTATE PLATFORM FROM OUR EXISTING LEGACY RETAIL FOOTPRINT TO A PORTFOLIO OF DESIGN GALLERIES THAT ARE SIZED TO THE POTENTIAL OF EACH MARKET AND THE SIZE OF OUR ASSORTMENT.  NEW DESIGN GALLERY SITES ARE IDENTIFIED BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, SUCH AS THE AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE NEW SITE LOCATIONS BASED ON SEVERAL STORE SPECIFIC ASPECTS INCLUDING GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND PROXIMITY TO AFFLUENT CONSUMERS, AND THE NEGOTIATION OF FAVORABLE ECONOMIC TERMS TO US FOR THE NEW LOCATION, AS WELL AS SATISFACTORY AND TIMELY COMPLETION OF REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING PROCUREMENT OF PERMITS AND COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPERATE DESIGN GALLERIES IN 60 TO 70 LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. THE NUMBER OF DESIGN GALLERIES WE OPEN IN ANY FISCAL YEAR IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THESE VARIABLES AND INDIVIDUAL NEW DESIGN GALLERIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO DELAY OR POSTPONEMENT DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SPECIFIC PROJECTS.  WE OPENED OUR PORTLAND DESIGN GALLERY IN MARCH 2018, OUR NASHVILLE DESIGN GALLERY IN JUNE 2018, AS WELL AS OUR NEW YORK DESIGN GALLERY AND OUR DESIGN GALLERY IN YOUNTVILLE, CALIFORNIA IN THE NAPA VALLEY, IN SEPTEMBER 2018. OUR GALLERIES IN NASHVILLE, NEW YORK AND YOUNTVILLE INCLUDE INTEGRATED CAFE\\u0301S, WINE VAULTS AND BARISTA BARS.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED KEY LEARNINGS FROM OUR REAL ESTATE TRANSFORMATION THAT HAVE SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW MULTI-TIER MARKET APPROACH THAT WE BELIEVE WILL OPTIMIZE BOTH MARKET SHARE AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL.  FIRST, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW RH PROTOTYPE DESIGN GALLERY THAT IS AN INNOVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE BLUEPRINT WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL ENABLE US TO MORE QUICKLY PLACE OUR DISRUPTIVE PRODUCT ASSORTMENT AND IMMERSIVE RETAIL EXPERIENCE INTO THE MARKET. THE NEW MODEL IS A STANDARD WE WILL UTILIZE IN THE FUTURE THAT IS BASED ON KEY LEARNINGS FROM OUR RECENT GALLERY OPENINGS AND WILL RANGE IN SIZE FROM 33,000 LEASED SELLING SQUARE FEET INCLUSIVE OF OUR INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE TO 29,000 LEASED SELLING SQUARE FEET WITHOUT. THESE NEW GALLERIES WILL REPRESENT OUR ASSORTMENTS FROM RH INTERIORS, MODERN, BABY & CHILD, TEEN AND OUTDOOR AND CONTAIN INTERIOR DESIGN OFFICES AND PRESENTATION ROOMS WHERE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS CAN WORK WITH CLIENTS ON THEIR PROJECTS. DUE TO THE REDUCED SQUARE FOOTAGE COMPARED TO OUR RECENT DESIGN GALLERY OPENINGS AND EFFICIENT DESIGN, THIS NEW MODEL WILL BE MORE CAPITAL EFFICIENT WITH LESS TIME AND COST RISK, BUT YIELD SIMILAR PRODUCTIVITY. WE ANTICIPATE THE NEW PROTOTYPE DESIGN GALLERIES WILL REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF OUR TARGET MARKETS. FUTURE PROTOTYPE LOCATION EXAMPLES INCLUDE EDINA, MN, CORTE MADERA, CA, COLUMBUS, OH AND CHARLOTTE, NC.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SECOND, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND OPEN LARGER BESPOKE DESIGN GALLERIES IN THE TOP METROPOLITAN MARKETS, SIMILAR TO THOSE WE OPENED IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO. THESE ICONIC LOCATIONS ARE HIGHLY PROFITABLE STATEMENTS FOR OUR BRAND, AND WE BELIEVE THEY CREATE A LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DUPLICATE.  THIRD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPEN INDIGENOUS BESPOKE GALLERIES IN THE BEST SECOND HOME MARKETS WHERE THE WEALTHY AND AFFLUENT VISIT AND VACATION. THESE GALLERIES ARE TAILORED TO REFLECT THE LOCAL CULTURE AND ARE SIZED TO THE POTENTIAL OF EACH MARKET. EXAMPLES OF INDIGENOUS BESPOKE GALLERIES INCLUDE THE HAMPTONS, PALM BEACH, YOUNTVILLE AND ASPEN.  FOURTH, WE ARE DEVELOPING A NEW GALLERY MODEL TAILORED TO SECONDARY MARKETS. TARGETED TO BE 10,000 TO 18,000 SQUARE FEET, WE BELIEVE THESE SMALLER EXPRESSIONS OF OUR BRAND WILL ENABLE US TO GAIN SHARE IN MARKETS CURRENTLY ONLY SERVED BY SMALLER COMPETITORS. EXAMPLES OF TARGET SECONDARY MARKETS INCLUDE HARTFORD, CT, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK AND MILWAUKEE, WI, AMONG OTHERS. WE EXPECT THESE GALLERIES TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIALLY SMALLER NET INVESTMENT THAN OUR LARGER DESIGN GALLERIES AND TO PAY BACK OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT WITHIN TWO YEARS IN MOST INSTANCES. OUR PLAN IS TO TEST A FEW OF THESE GALLERIES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, AND IF PROVEN SUCCESSFUL, THIS FORMAT COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OUR LONG-TERM GALLERY TARGETS.  WE BELIEVE OUR MULTI-TIER MARKET APPROACH TO TRANSFORMING OUR REAL ESTATE WILL ENABLE US TO RAMP OUR OPENING CADENCE FROM 3 TO 5 NEW GALLERIES PER YEAR, TO A PACE OF 5 TO 7 NEW GALLERIES PER YEAR COMMENCING IN FISCAL 2020.  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR STANDALONE RH BABY & CHILD, RH TEEN AND RH MODERN GALLERIES IN SELECT MARKETS.  LIKE OUR EVOLVING MULTI-TIER MARKET APPROACH, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A MULTI-TIER REAL ESTATE STRATEGY THAT IS DESIGNED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR UNIT LEVEL PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. OUR THREE PRIMARY DEAL CONSTRUCTS ARE OUTLINED BELOW.  \\u25cf  FIRST,  DUE TO THE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROOF OF CONCEPT OF OUR RECENT NEW GALLERIES, AND THE ADDITION OF A POWERFUL, TRAFFIC-GENERATING HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE, WE ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE \\u201cCAPITAL LIGHT\\u201d LEASING DEALS, WHERE AS MUCH AS 65% TO 100% OF THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THE LANDLORD, VERSUS 35% TO 50% PREVIOUSLY.  \\u25cf  SECOND, IN SEVERAL OF OUR CURRENT PROJECTS, WE ARE MIGRATING FROM A LEASING TO A DEVELOPMENT MODEL. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO GALLERIES, YOUNTVILLE AND EDINA, USING THIS NEW MODEL, AND HAVE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE. IN THE CASE OF YOUNTVILLE AND EDINA, WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE A SALE-LEASEBACK THAT SHOULD ALLOW US TO RECOUP ALL OR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR CAPITAL. IN SOME CASES WE BELIEVE WE MAY BE ABLE TO PRE-SELL THE PROPERTY AND STRUCTURE THE TRANSACTION WHERE THE CAPITAL TO BUILD THE PROJECT IS ADVANCED BY THE BUYER DURING CONSTRUCTION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE ZERO UPFRONT CAPITAL FROM US.  \\u25cf  THIRD,  WE ARE WORKING ON JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS, WHERE WE SHARE THE UPSIDE OF A DEVELOPMENT WITH THE DEVELOPER/LANDLORD. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS NEW MODEL WOULD BE OUR FUTURE GALLERY AND GUESTHOUSE IN ASPEN, WHERE WE ARE CONTRIBUTING THE VALUE OF OUR LEASE TO THE DEVELOPMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A PROFITS INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DEVELOPER WILL DELIVER TO RH A SUBSTANTIALLY TURNKEY GALLERY AND GUESTHOUSE, WHILE WE CONTINUE TO RETAIN A 20% AND 25% PROFITS INTEREST IN THE PROPERTIES, RESPECTIVELY. WE WOULD EXPECT TO MONETIZE THE PROFITS INTEREST AT THE TIME OF SALE OF THE PROPERTIES DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. THE NET RESULT SHOULD BE A MINIMAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO OPERATIONALIZE THE BUSINESS, WITH THE EXPECTATION FOR A NET POSITIVE CAPITAL BENEFIT AT TIME OF MONETIZATION OF THE PROFITS INTEREST.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT ALL OF THE ABOVE DEAL STRUCTURES SHOULD LEAD TO LOWER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, HIGHER UNIT PROFITABILITY, AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL VERSUS OUR PRIOR GALLERY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \\u25cf  EXPAND OUR OFFERING AND INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE BY.  \\u25cf  TRANSFORMING OUR REAL ESTATE PLATFORM;  \\u25cf  GROWING OUR MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT AND INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND CATEGORIES;  \\u25cf  EXPANDING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING DESIGN SERVICES AND CAFES, WINE VAULTS AND COFFEE BARS AT OUR DESIGN GALLERIES;  \\u25cf  EXPLORING AND TESTING NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR CORE BUSINESS; AND  \\u25cf  INCREASING OUR BRAND AWARENESS AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY THROUGH OUR SOURCE BOOK CIRCULATION STRATEGY, MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM, OUR DIGITAL MARKETING INITIATIVES, ADVERTISING, AND PUBLIC RELATIONS ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS.  DURING FISCAL 2017 AND FISCAL 2018 WE DEFERRED THE INTRODUCTION OF MAJOR NEW PRODUCT CATEGORY EXPANSIONS OTHER THAN THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF RH HOSPITALITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH NEW DESIGN GALLERIES. IN FISCAL 2019, WE HAVE RESUMED INTRODUCING EXPANSIONS IN OUR MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT INCLUDING A NUMBER OF NEW MERCHANDISE COLLECTIONS IN BOTH RH INTERIORS AND RH MODERN, AS WELL AS THE LAUNCH OF RH BEACH HOUSE IN THE SPRING AND RH SKI HOUSE IN THE FALL.  WE ALSO PLAN TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN RH INTERIOR DESIGN IN FISCAL 2019 WITH A GOAL OF BUILDING THE LEADING INTERIOR DESIGN FIRM IN NORTH AMERICA. WE BELIEVE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE OPPORTUNITY BY OFFERING WORLD CLASS DESIGN AND INSTALLATION SERVICES AS WE MOVE THE BRAND BEYOND CREATING AND SELLING PRODUCTS, TO CONCEPTUALIZING AND SELLING SPACES.  \\u25cf  ARCHITECT NEW OPERATING PLATFORM.  WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS ARCHITECTING A NEW OPERATING PLATFORM, INCLUSIVE OF TRANSITIONING FROM A PROMOTIONAL TO MEMBERSHIP MODEL, OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK REDESIGN, THE REDESIGN OF OUR REVERSE LOGISTICS AND OUTLET BUSINESS, AND THE RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF OUR HOME DELIVERY AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, WHICH ENABLES US TO DRIVE LOWER COSTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS, AND HIGHER EARNINGS AND INVENTORY TURNS. LOOKING FORWARD, WE EXPECT THIS MULTI-YEAR EFFORT TO RESULT IN A DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, CONTINUED MARGIN ENHANCEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  \\u25cf  GROW OUR INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE.  IN 2015 WE BEGAN TO INTRODUCE AN INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING CAFE\\u0301S, WINE VAULTS AND BARISTA BARS, INTO A NUMBER OF OUR NEW GALLERY LOCATIONS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR INITIAL HOSPITALITY OFFERING IN CHICAGO LED US TO BROADEN THIS INITIATIVE BY ADDING HOSPITALITY TO A NUMBER OF OUR OTHER NEW GALLERY LOCATIONS. WE BELIEVE THIS HAS CREATED A UNIQUE NEW RETAIL EXPERIENCE THAT CANNOT BE REPLICATED ONLINE, AND THAT THE ADDITION OF HOSPITALITY IS HELPING TO DRIVE INCREMENTAL SALES OF HOME FURNISHINGS IN THESE GALLERIES.  \\u25cf  PURSUE INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LUXURY BRAND POSITIONING AND UNIQUE AESTHETIC WILL HAVE STRONG INTERNATIONAL APPEAL. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THERE IS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RH BRAND TO EXPAND GLOBALLY AND ARE CURRENTLY EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DESIGN GALLERIES IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE.  BUSINESS INITIATIVES  WE ARE UNDERTAKING A LARGE NUMBER OF NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES IN SUPPORT OF OUR KEY VALUE DRIVING STRATEGIES. IN PARTICULAR, BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2016 AND CONTINUING THROUGH FISCAL 2019, WE HAVE PURSUED A RANGE OF STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \\u25cf  INTRODUCTION OF MEMBERSHIP MODEL.  IN MARCH 2016, WE INTRODUCED THE RH MEMBERS PROGRAM, AN EXCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP MODEL THAT REIMAGINES AND SIMPLIFIES THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. FOR AN ANNUAL FEE, THE RH MEMBERS PROGRAM PROVIDES A SET DISCOUNT EVERY DAY ACROSS ALL RH BRANDS IN ADDITION TO OTHER BENEFITS INCLUDING COMPLIMENTARY INTERIOR DESIGN SERVICES THROUGH THE RH INTERIOR DESIGN PROGRAM AND ELIGIBILITY FOR  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PREFERRED FINANCING PLANS ON THE RH CREDIT CARD, AMONG OTHERS. WE BELIEVE THAT TRANSITIONING OUR BUSINESS FROM A PROMOTIONAL TO MEMBERSHIP MODEL HAS ENHANCED OUR BRAND, SIMPLIFIED AND STREAMLINED OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS ALLOWED US TO DEVELOP DEEPER CONNECTIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.  \\u25cf  WE BELIEVE THAT THE SHIFT TO A MEMBERSHIP MODEL HAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS. SPECIFICALLY, WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE BENEFITS INCLUDE.  IMPROVED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE  . OUR INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS CAN NOW WORK WITH CUSTOMERS BASED ON THEIR TIMELINE AND PROJECT DEADLINES, AS OPPOSED TO OUR PRIOR PROMOTIONAL CALENDAR. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL LEAD TO LARGER OVERALL SALES TRANSACTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER DESIGN PROJECTS.  LOWER CANCELLATIONS AND RETURNS  . AS A RESULT OF THE ELIMINATION OF TIME-LIMITED PROMOTIONAL EVENTS AND THE ASSOCIATED PRESSURE OF PLACING AN ORDER BEFORE A PROMOTION EXPIRES, WE BELIEVE THE SHIFT TO A MEMBERSHIP MODEL HAS ALSO RESULTED IN LOWER RATES OF CANCELLED ORDERS AND RETURNS.  IMPROVED OPERATIONAL COSTS  . THE VOLUME OF SALES, ORDERS AND SHIPMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS UNDER THE PRIOR PROMOTIONAL MODEL WAS CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE SPIKES IN CUSTOMER ORDERS BASED UPON PROMOTIONAL EVENTS FOLLOWED BY LOWER ORDERS AND SALES AFTER THE END OF AN EVENT. THIS BUYING PATTERN ALSO AFFECTED NUMEROUS OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING STAFFING AND COSTS AS WE REQUIRED ELEVATED STAFFING LEVELS TO SERVICE THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS DURING PEAK SALES EVENTS. LIKEWISE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN SALES HAD DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR SUPPLY CHAIN RELATED TO MERCHANDISE ORDERS, MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION, SHIPMENT TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND FINAL DELIVERY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ALL OF THESE ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE EXPERIENCING IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES AS A RESULT OF THE MEMBERSHIP MODEL WHEREBY SALES ARE MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS OPPOSED TO THE PEAKS AND VALLEYS OF ORDERS AND SALES UNDER THE PRIOR MODEL.  \\u25cf  DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK REDESIGN.  AS A RESULT OF OUR WORK TO REDESIGN OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND OPTIMIZE INVENTORY, IN FISCAL 2017 WE WERE ABLE TO FOREGO BUILDING A FIFTH FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTER PLANNED TO OPEN AND CONSOLIDATE OUR CURRENT FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK FROM FOUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS TO TWO PRIMARY LOCATIONS (NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BALTIMORE, MARYLAND AREA). IN FISCAL 2017, WE COMPLETED THE CLOSURE OF OUR FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN LOS ANGELES AND DALLAS, ELIMINATING 1.75 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE, RESULTING IN SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF $20 MILLION ANNUALLY. IN FISCAL 2018, WE COMPLETED THE CLOSURE OF A SMALLER FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN ESSEX, MARYLAND, ELIMINATING 500,000 SQUARE FEET OF DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE, RESULTING IN SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF $5 MILLION ANNUALLY. WE BELIEVE MANAGING OUR BUSINESS IN FEWER FACILITIES WHILE DECREASING OUR ON-HAND INVENTORY WILL REDUCE FULFILLMENT COMPLEXITY, LOWER INVENTORY TRANSFER COSTS, INCREASE INVENTORY TURNS, IMPROVE WORKING CAPITAL AND SHOULD RESULT IN HIGHER GROSS MARGINS OVER TIME.  \\u25cf  RECONCEPTUALIZE REVERSE LOGISTICS BUSINESS.  IN FISCAL 2017, WE IMPLEMENTED INITIATIVES TO RE-CONCEPTUALIZE OUR OUTLET AND REVERSE LOGISTICS BUSINESS. PREVIOUSLY, RETURNS OF FURNITURE WOULD BE TRANSFERRED VIA OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS BACK TO A FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTER, THEN EVENTUALLY TO ONE OF OUR OUTLET LOCATIONS. NOW, RETURNS OF FURNITURE ARE TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY FROM OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS TO OUTLETS, WHICH HAS REDUCED TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING COSTS, AND IMPROVED SELLING MARGINS ACROSS OUR OUTLET NETWORK. WE BELIEVE THIS INITIATIVE YIELDED SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS AND MARGIN ENHANCEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION ANNUALLY.  \\u25cf  LUXURY IN-HOME FURNITURE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE.  WE BELIEVE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BY ENHANCING OUR APPROACH TO SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH IN-HOME DELIVERY. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE OUR LEVEL OF CONTROL AND IMPROVE SERVICES LEVELS OVER THE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE TO THE CUSTOMER\\u2019S RESIDENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO DEVELOP IMPROVED SOLUTIONS FOR IN-HOME DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER IN THE LUXURY MARKET. WE HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED A NUMBER OF SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE YIELDING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND REDUCTIONS IN PRODUCT RETURN AND EXCHANGE RATES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO OPTIMIZE OUR SERVICE OFFERING TO CUSTOMERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE IN-HOME DELIVERY EXPERIENCE AND ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD WILL CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL RESULTS.  \\u25cf  ELEVATE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE END-TO-END CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. AS WE HAVE ELEVATED OUR BRAND, ESPECIALLY AT RETAIL, WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO ENHANCE THE BRAND EXPERIENCE IN OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE MAKING CHANGES IN MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES THAT AFFECT OUR  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE IN-HOME DELIVERY EXPERIENCE, IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCT QUALITY AND ENHANCEMENTS IN SOURCING, PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, AND ALL ASPECTS OF CUSTOMER CARE AND SERVICE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF EXPERIENTIAL BRAND-ENHANCING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS EXPANDED DESIGN ATELIERS, THE RH INTERIOR DESIGN PROGRAM AND  THE LAUNCH OF  AN INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE IN A NUMBER OF OUR NEW GALLERIES,  WILL  FURTHER  ENHANCE  OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 IN-STORE EXPERIENCE, ALLOWING US TO FURTHER DISRUPT THE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED HOME FURNISHINGS LANDSCAPE AND ACHIEVE MARKET SHARE GAINS.  \\u200b  IN FISCAL 2017, FISCAL 2018 AND CONTINUING INTO FISCAL 2019, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATIONS AND CURRENT INITIATIVES ARE PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO OPTIMIZE THE ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING GENERATING FREE CASH FLOW AND OPTIMIZING OUR BALANCE SHEET, AS WELL AS DEPLOYING CAPITAL TO REPAY DEBT AND REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH WE BELIEVE CREATES A LONG-TERM BENEFIT TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE AND TEST NUMEROUS INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDING THROUGH EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE INVENTORY, ELEVATE THE HOME DELIVERY EXPERIENCE, SIMPLIFY OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND IMPROVE OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN INCLUDING BY STREAMLINING AND REALIGNING OUR HOME OFFICE OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERING AND TRANSFORM OUR REAL ESTATE USING A RANGE OF DIFFERENT MODELS FOR SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE OPERATIONAL BENEFITS AND FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE STRATEGIC EFFORTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PURSUIT OF MULTIPLE INITIATIVES WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY RESULT IN PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN, AND INCREASED FLUCTUATION IN, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR COSTS AND EXPENSES IN THE SHORT TERM WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. DELAYS IN COMPLETION OF OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OR COSTS OVERRUNS COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION. FURTHER, MACROECONOMIC OR POLITICAL EVENTS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE OUR INITIATIVES OR THE SUCCESS OF SUCH INITIATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE TARIFFS IMPOSED TO DATE HAVE NOT HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR REVENUES, MARGINS AND EARNINGS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EXISTING TARIFFS AND THE ADDITIONAL TARRIFFS THAT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE, AS WELL AS OTHER FUTURE TARIFFS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED, WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION IN FUTURE TIME PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IN RECENT PERIODS THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AS WELL AS PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT DECLINE, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL HEALTH AND DEMAND LEVELS OF HIGH-END CONSUMERS, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER SUCH TRENDS WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. THE HOUSING MARKET IS AFFECTED BY A RANGE OF FACTORS INCLUDING HOME PRICES AND INTEREST RATES AND SLOWDOWNS IN THE HOUSING MARKET CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE HIGHER END HOUSING MARKET IN PARTICULAR MAY HAVE AN OUTSIZED INFLUENCE ON OUR LEVELS OF CONSUMER DEMAND SINCE OUR BUSINESS IS GEARED TOWARD THE HIGHER END OF THE HOME FURNISHINGS MARKET. THE ABOVE FACTORS AND OTHER CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES MAY CREATE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUES AND PROFIT IN THE NEAR TERM.  \\u200b  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  THREE MONTHS ENDED  \\u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED  \\u200b  \\u200b  AUGUST 3,  \\u200b  AUGUST 4,  \\u200b  AUGUST 3,  \\u200b  AUGUST 4,  \\u200b  2019  2018  2019  2018  \\u200b  \\u200b  (IN THOUSANDS)  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  NET REVENUES  \\u200b  $706,514  \\u200b  $640,798  \\u200b  $1,304,935  \\u200b  $1,198,204  COST OF GOODS SOLD  \\u200b  411,556  \\u200b  372,454  \\u200b  777,163  \\u200b  720,527  GROSS PROFIT  \\u200b  294,958  \\u200b  268,344  \\u200b  527,772  \\u200b  477,677  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  \\u200b  190,977  \\u200b  186,521  \\u200b  355,158  \\u200b  347,707  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  \\u200b  103,981  \\u200b  81,823  \\u200b  172,614  \\u200b  129,970  OTHER EXPENSES  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  INTEREST EXPENSE\\u2014NET  \\u200b  24,513  \\u200b  15,467  \\u200b  45,631  \\u200b  30,565  (GAIN) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT  \\u200b  (954)  \\u200b  917  \\u200b  (954)  \\u200b  917  TOTAL OTHER EXPENSES  \\u200b  23,559  \\u200b  16,384  \\u200b  44,677  \\u200b  31,482  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  \\u200b  80,422  \\u200b  65,439  \\u200b  127,937  \\u200b  98,488  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  \\u200b  16,665  \\u200b  2,533  \\u200b  28,458  \\u200b  10,121  NET INCOME  \\u200b  $63,757  \\u200b  $62,906  \\u200b  $99,479  \\u200b  $88,367  OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  ADJUSTED NET INCOME  (1)  \\u200b  $71,430  \\u200b  $54,509  \\u200b  $119,671  \\u200b  $87,161  ADJUSTED EBITDA  (2)  \\u200b  $133,716  \\u200b  $103,054  \\u200b  $234,101  \\u200b  $180,794  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \\u200b  $17,367  \\u200b  $25,657  \\u200b  $25,283  \\u200b  $42,916  LANDLORD ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION\\u2014NET OF TENANT ALLOWANCES  \\u200b  \\u200b  23,013  \\u200b  \\u200b  8,997  \\u200b  \\u200b  27,555  \\u200b  \\u200b  27,645  ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  (3)  \\u200b  $40,380  \\u200b  $34,654  \\u200b  $52,838  \\u200b  $70,561  \\u200b  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (1)  ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT IS NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d). WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME, ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN NON-RECURRING AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK REDESIGN RESULTING IN REDUCED DELIVERY EXPENSE AND LEVERAGE IN OCCUPANCY COSTS, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR CORE MERCHANDISE MARGINS.

WE INCURRED A $0.9 MILLION LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018 DUE TO THE REPAYMENT IN FULL OF THE LILO TERM LOAN, THE PROMISSORY NOTE SECURED BY OUR AIRCRAFT AND THE EQUIPMENT SECURITY NOTES IN JUNE 2018, WHICH INCLUDES ACCELERATION OF AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $0.6 MILLION AND A PREPAYMENT PENALTY OF $0.3 MILLION.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS $28.5 MILLION AND $10.1 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AND AUGUST 4, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 22.2% AND 10.3% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AND AUGUST 4, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO NET EXCESS TAX WINDFALLS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS AUGUST 4, 2018, AS WELL AS A DISCRETE TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  \\u200b  \\u200b  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  GENERAL  THE PRIMARY CASH NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, PAYROLL, SOURCE BOOKS, STORE RENT, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND UPDATING EXISTING STORES, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. WE SEEK OUT AND EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFECTIVELY  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGING AND DEPLOYING CAPITAL IN WAYS THAT IMPROVE WORKING CAPITAL AND SUPPORT AND ENHANCE OUR BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND STRATEGIES. IN FISCAL 2017, WE COMPLETED TWO SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1 BILLION. A $300 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE WAS COMPLETED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017 AND A $700 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE WAS COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017. IN OCTOBER 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW $700 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OF WHICH $250 MILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES WERE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2018, AND THE $700 MILLION AUTHORIZATION AMOUNT WAS REPLENISHED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN MARCH 2019. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR AN AGGREGATE REPURCHASE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION, WITH $450 MILLION STILL AVAILABLE UNDER THE $700 MILLION REPURCHASE PROGRAM. REFER TO \\u201cSHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\\u201d BELOW. WE INTEND TO EVALUATE OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION FROM TIME TO TIME AND MAY ENGAGE IN FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE BUYING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK REPRESENTS A GOOD VALUE AND PROVIDES A FAVORABLE RETURN FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE HAVE $635 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING, OF WHICH $300 MILLION MATURE IN JUNE 2020 AND $335 MILLION MATURE IN JUNE 2023. BASED ON ANTICIPATED STRONG CASH FLOW GENERATION IN 2019 AND BEYOND, WE EXPECT TO REPAY THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES AT MATURITY IN JUNE 2020 AND JUNE 2023 IN CASH TO MINIMIZE DILUTION. WHILE WE ANTICIPATE USING EXCESS CASH, FREE CASH FLOW AND BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT TO REPAY THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN CASH TO MINIMIZE DILUTION, WE MAY NEED TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY TO REPAY SUCH CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN CASH AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL TO FUND SUCH REPAYMENTS, OR THAT IF CAPITAL IS AVAILABLE THROUGH ADDITIONAL DEBT ISSUANCES OR REFINANCING OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES, THAT SUCH CAPITAL WILL BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US. WE BELIEVE THE STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE REDUCTION IN LEVERAGE WE HAVE ACHIEVED DURING THE PAST YEAR PUTS US IN A STRONG POSITION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS OPPORTUNISTICALLY. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MULTIPLE FINANCING ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO US ON FAVORABLE TERMS THAT COULD PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION.  WE EXTENDED AND AMENDED OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT IN JUNE 2017, WHICH HAS A TOTAL AVAILABILITY OF $600 MILLION, OF WHICH $10 MILLION IS AVAILABLE TO RESTORATION HARDWARE CANADA, INC., AND INCLUDES A $200 MILLION ACCORDION FEATURE UNDER WHICH THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT MAY BE EXPANDED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES FROM $600 MILLION TO UP TO $800 MILLION IF AND TO THE EXTENT THE LENDERS REVISE THEIR CREDIT COMMITMENTS TO ENCOMPASS A LARGER FACILITY. THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT HAS A MATURITY DATE OF JUNE 28, 2022.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ASSET BASED CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CAPITAL NEEDS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  OUR BUSINESS HAS RELIED ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, AS WELL AS BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE PURSUED IN THE PAST, AND MAY PURSUE IN THE FUTURE, ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FOR OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE STRATEGIC SALE OF ASSETS, UTILIZATION OF OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, AND ENTRY INTO NEW DEBT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS THAT PRESENT ATTRACTIVE TERMS.  WE MAY PURSUE STRATEGIES IN THE FUTURE, THROUGH THE USE OF EXISTING ASSETS AND DEBT FACILITIES, OR THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF NEW EXTERNAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS, TO FUND OUR STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE STOCKHOLDER VALUE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WHETHER RAISED THROUGH THE SALE OF ASSETS, UTILIZATION OF OUR EXISTING DEBT FINANCING SOURCES, OR PURSUIT OF ADDITIONAL DEBT FINANCING SOURCES, WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US ON A TIMELY MANNER, ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. TO THE EXTENT WE PURSUE ADDITIONAL DEBT AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, OUR CAPITALIZATION PROFILE MAY CHANGE AND MAY INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE, AND AS A RESULT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE FUTURE LIQUIDITY TO REPAY SUCH INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS WHICH AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FUTURE USES OF CAPITAL.  IN ADDITION, OUR CAPITAL NEEDS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OR NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CHOOSE TO PURSUE. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN REMODELING AND OPENING NEW DESIGN GALLERIES, AND THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE OPEN ADDITIONAL DESIGN GALLERIES, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO UNDERTAKE UPGRADES TO HISTORICAL BUILDINGS OR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW BUILDINGS.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE (I) CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND (II) CASH OUTFLOWS OF CAPITAL RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES TO DESIGN AND BUILD LANDLORD LEASED ASSETS, NET OF TENANT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED. WE ANTICIPATE OUR ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE $160 MILLION TO $170 MILLION IN FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR EFFORTS TO CONTINUE OUR GROWTH AND EXPANSION, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION OF NEW DESIGN GALLERIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR FISCAL 2019 ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS OF $50 MILLION TO $60 MILLION. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $52.8 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF CASH RECEIVED RELATED TO LANDLORD TENANT ALLOWANCES OF $15.7 MILLION.  CERTAIN LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRE THE LANDLORD TO FUND A PORTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION RELATED COSTS THROUGH PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO US. OTHER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS FOR OUR NEW DESIGN GALLERIES REQUIRE THE LANDLORD TO FUND A PORTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION RELATED COSTS DIRECTLY TO THIRD PARTIES, RATHER THAN THROUGH TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION ALLOWANCES AND ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE CONTRIBUTIONS DIRECTLY FROM OUR LANDLORDS RELATED TO THE BUILDING OF OUR DESIGN GALLERIES. AS WE DEVELOP NEW GALLERIES, AS WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN THE FUTURE LIKE OUR INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE, WE MAY EXPLORE OTHER MODELS FOR OUR REAL ESTATE, WHICH COULD INCLUDE LONGER LEASE TERMS OR FURTHER PURCHASES OF, OR JOINT VENTURES OR OTHER FORMS OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN, REAL ESTATE INTERESTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW SITES AND BUILDINGS. THESE APPROACHES MIGHT REQUIRE GREATER CAPITAL INVESTMENT ON OUR PART THAN A TRADITIONAL STORE LEASE WITH A LANDLORD. WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSITION OUR REAL ESTATE STRATEGY FROM A LEASING MODEL TO A DEVELOPMENT MODEL, WHERE WE POTENTIALLY BUY AND DEVELOP OUR DESIGN GALLERIES THEN RECOUP THE INVESTMENTS THROUGH A SALE LEASEBACK ARRANGEMENT RESULTING IN LOWER CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND LOWER RENT. IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH CAPITAL AND OTHER EXPENDITURES REQUIRE US TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN SECURING ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS OR AT ALL.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES, OR WILL BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO FUND ALL OF OUR INITIATIVES, OR THAT SUFFICIENT INCREMENTAL DEBT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US IN ORDER TO FUND OUR CASH PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE REPAYMENT OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $635 MILLION AT MATURITY OF SUCH SENIOR CONVERTIBLE NOTES. IN ADDITION, AGREEMENTS GOVERNING EXISTING OR NEW DEBT FACILITIES MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS IN THE MANNER WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OR TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING COMMITMENTS INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES IN CASH UPON MATURITY OF SUCH SENIOR NOTES. TO THE EXTENT WE NEED TO SEEK WAIVERS FROM ANY PROVIDER OF DEBT FINANCING, OR WE FAIL TO OBSERVE THE COVENANTS OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF EXISTING OR NEW DEBT FACILITIES, ANY SUCH EVENT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS INCLUDING TRIGGERING CROSS DEFAULTS OR OTHER CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO OTHER INDEBTEDNESS. OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS, AND ANY ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS THAT WE MAY INCUR, EXPOSES US TO CERTAIN RISKS WITH REGARDS TO INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND FLUCTUATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS OR TO REFINANCE ANY OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO MANAGE SUCH INTEREST RATES MAY BE LIMITED OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, MACROECONOMIC TRENDS AND OTHER RISKS.  ANY WEAKENING OF, OR OTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN, THE U.S. OR GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS FUTURE DEBT. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE NECESSARY FUNDS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, OR THAT FUTURE FINANCING REQUIREMENTS WOULD NOT REQUIRE US TO RAISE MONEY THROUGH AN EQUITY FINANCING OR BY OTHER MEANS THAT COULD BE DILUTIVE TO HOLDERS OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK. IF WE FAIL TO RAISE SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELAY OR ABANDON SOME OF OUR PLANNED FUTURE EXPENDITURES OR ASPECTS OF OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOW ANALYSIS  A SUMMARY OF OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS SET FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED  \\u200b  \\u200b  AUGUST 3,  \\u200b  AUGUST 4,  \\u200b  \\u200b  2019  2018  \\u200b  \\u200b  (IN THOUSANDS)  PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \\u200b  $97,133  \\u200b  $49,020  \\u200b  USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \\u200b  (25,283)  \\u200b  (42,916)  \\u200b  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  \\u200b  (66,023)  \\u200b  (6,350)  \\u200b  INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS  \\u200b  5,752  \\u200b  (370)  \\u200b  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS AT END OF PERIOD  \\u200b  11,555  \\u200b  24,944  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.

THE 2023 NOTES ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF AN INDENTURE BETWEEN US AND U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS THE TRUSTEE. THE 2023 NOTES WILL MATURE ON JUNE 15, 2023, UNLESS EARLIER PURCHASED BY US OR CONVERTED.

THE CONVERSION RATE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN SPECIFIED EVENTS, BUT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST. IN ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A \\u201cMAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE\\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE, WE WILL, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCREASE THE CONVERSION RATE BY A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR A HOLDER THAT ELECTS TO CONVERT ITS 2023 NOTES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.  PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2023, THE 2023 NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE ONLY UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) DURING ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, IF, FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS (WHETHER OR NOT CONSECUTIVE) DURING THE 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD ENDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR QUARTER, THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON SUCH TRADING DAY IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 130% OF THE APPLICABLE CONVERSION PRICE ON SUCH TRADING DAY; (2) DURING THE FIVE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAY PERIOD AFTER ANY TEN CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD IN WHICH, FOR EACH DAY OF THAT PERIOD, THE TRADING PRICE PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2023 NOTES FOR SUCH TRADING DAY WAS LESS THAN 98% OF THE PRODUCT OF THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE APPLICABLE CONVERSION RATE ON SUCH TRADING DAY; OR (3) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIFIED CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, NONE OF THESE CONDITIONS HAVE OCCURRED AND, AS A RESULT, THE 2023 NOTES WERE NOT CONVERTIBLE AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019. ON AND AFTER MARCH 15, 2023, UNTIL THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THE SECOND SCHEDULED TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE MATURITY DATE, HOLDERS MAY CONVERT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2023 NOTES AT ANY TIME, REGARDLESS OF THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES. UPON CONVERSION, THE 2023 NOTES WILL BE SETTLED, AT OUR ELECTION, IN CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  57  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE MAY NOT REDEEM THE 2023 NOTES; HOWEVER, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES), HOLDERS MAY REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2023 NOTES FOR CASH AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2023 NOTES TO BE PURCHASED PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE PURCHASE DATE.  UNDER GAAP, CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH ON CONVERSION ARE REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR AS LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE INSTRUMENT IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUER\\u2019S NON-CONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE. ACCORDINGLY, IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2023 NOTES, WE SEPARATED THE 2023 NOTES INTO LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT WAS CALCULATED BY MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF A SIMILAR LIABILITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN ASSOCIATED CONVERTIBLE FEATURE. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY COMPONENT, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS A DEBT DISCOUNT, REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2023 NOTES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE 2023 NOTES. THE EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OVER ITS CARRYING AMOUNT (\\u201cDEBT DISCOUNT\\u201d) WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 6.35% OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2023 NOTES. THE EQUITY COMPONENT IS NOT REMEASURED AS LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO MEET THE CONDITIONS FOR EQUITY CLASSIFICATION.  IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2023 NOTES, WE ALLOCATED THE TOTAL AMOUNT INCURRED TO THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE VALUES. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT ARE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2023 NOTES, AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT ARE NETTED WITH THE EQUITY COMPONENT IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT).  DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE 2023 NOTES WERE COMPRISED OF DISCOUNTS UPON ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF $1.7 MILLION AND THIRD PARTY OFFERING COSTS OF $4.6 MILLION. DISCOUNTS AND THIRD PARTY OFFERING COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT ARE RECORDED AS A CONTRA-LIABILITY AND ARE PRESENTED NET AGAINST THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 BALANCE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  2023 NOTES\\u2014CONVERTIBLE BOND HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS  IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING OF THE 2023 NOTES AND THE EXERCISE OF THE OVERALLOTMENT OPTION IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY WE HAVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $193.65 PER SHARE. THE TOTAL COST OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WAS $91.9 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE SOLD WARRANTS WHEREBY THE HOLDERS OF THE WARRANTS HAVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $309.84 PER SHARE. THE WARRANTS CONTAIN CERTAIN ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS WHEREBY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER SUCH WARRANTS MAY BE INCREASED UP TO A CAP OF 3.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (WHICH CAP MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT). WE RECEIVED $51.0 MILLION IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE WARRANTS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE PURCHASE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES AND SALE OF THE WARRANTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET ANY ACTUAL EARNINGS DILUTION FROM THE CONVERSION OF THE 2023 NOTES UNTIL OUR COMMON STOCK IS ABOVE APPROXIMATELY $309.84 PER SHARE. AS THESE TRANSACTIONS MEET CERTAIN ACCOUNTING CRITERIA, THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES AND WARRANTS ARE RECORDED IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT), ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVES AND ARE NOT REMEASURED EACH REPORTING PERIOD. THE NET COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS WERE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  WE RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $22.3 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT DISCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2023 NOTES AND RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OF $22.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND DEFERRED TAX ASSET ARE RECORDED IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020  IN JUNE 2015, WE ISSUED IN A PRIVATE OFFERING $250 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND, IN JULY 2015, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $50 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PURSUANT TO THE EXERCISE OF THE OVERALLOTMENT OPTION GRANTED TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AS PART OF OUR JUNE 2015 OFFERING (COLLECTIVELY, THE \\u201c2020 NOTES\\u201d).

THE INITIAL CONVERSION RATE APPLICABLE TO THE 2020 NOTES IS 8.4656 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2020 NOTES, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $118.13 PER SHARE. THE CONVERSION RATE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN SPECIFIED EVENTS, BUT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST. IN ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A \\u201cMAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE\\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE, WE WILL, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCREASE THE CONVERSION RATE BY A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR A HOLDER THAT ELECTS TO CONVERT ITS 2020 NOTES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.

AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, NONE OF THESE CONDITIONS HAVE OCCURRED AND, AS A RESULT, THE 2020 NOTES WERE NOT CONVERTIBLE AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019. ON AND AFTER MARCH 15, 2020, UNTIL THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THE SECOND SCHEDULED TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE MATURITY DATE, HOLDERS MAY CONVERT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2020 NOTES AT ANY TIME, REGARDLESS OF THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES. UPON CONVERSION, THE 2020 NOTES WILL BE SETTLED, AT OUR ELECTION, IN CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  WE MAY NOT REDEEM THE 2020 NOTES; HOWEVER, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES), HOLDERS MAY REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2020 NOTES FOR CASH AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2020 NOTES TO BE PURCHASED PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE PURCHASE DATE.

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY COMPONENT, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS A DEBT DISCOUNT, REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2020 NOTES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE 2020 NOTES. THE DEBT DISCOUNT WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 6.47% OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2020 NOTES. THE EQUITY COMPONENT IS NOT REMEASURED AS LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO MEET THE CONDITIONS FOR EQUITY CLASSIFICATION.  IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2020 NOTES, WE ALLOCATED THE TOTAL AMOUNT INCURRED TO THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE VALUES. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT ARE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2020 NOTES, AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT ARE NETTED WITH THE EQUITY COMPONENT IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT).

WE RECEIVED $30.4 MILLION IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE WARRANTS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE PURCHASE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES AND SALE OF THE WARRANTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET ANY ACTUAL EARNINGS DILUTION FROM THE CONVERSION OF THE 2020 NOTES UNTIL OUR COMMON STOCK IS ABOVE APPROXIMATELY $189.00 PER SHARE.

THE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN BEARS INTEREST AT AN ANNUAL RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR PLUS 6.50%. THIS RATE IS A FLOATING RATE THAT RESETS PERIODICALLY BASED UPON CHANGES IN LIBOR RATES DURING THE LIFE OF THE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN. AT THE DATE OF THE INITIAL BORROWING, THE RATE WAS SET AT ONE MONTH LIBOR PLUS 6.50%.  ALL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN ARE SECURED BY A SECOND LIEN SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE LOAN PARTIES, INCLUDING INVENTORY, RECEIVABLES AND CERTAIN TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE SECOND LIEN SECURITY INTEREST ENCUMBERS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE CREDIT. THE SECOND LIEN RANKS JUNIOR IN PRIORITY AND IS SUBORDINATED TO THE FIRST LIEN IN FAVOR OF THE LENDERS WITH RESPECT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE BORROWINGS UNDER THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT MAY BE PREPAID IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MINIMUM PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS, AND INCLUDING (I) A PREPAYMENT PREMIUM IN THE AMOUNT OF 2.0% OF THE  63  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN BEING PREPAID DURING THE FIRST YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT, (II) 1.0% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN BEING PREPAID DURING THE SECOND YEAR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND (III) NO PREPAYMENT PREMIUM AFTER THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A FINANCIAL RATIO COVENANT NOT FOUND IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BASED UPON A NET SENIOR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED SECURED DEBT TO CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS FOLLOWS.  \\u25cf  THE NET SENIOR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO TEST IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF (I) THE SUM OF (A) ALL OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN AND THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PLUS (B) ALL OTHER SECURED INDEBTEDNESS OF RH AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS (X) SENIOR OR PARI PASSU TO THE LIEN ON THE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN COLLATERAL OR (Y) SECURED BY PROPERTY THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN COLLATERAL UNDER THE SECOND LIEN TERM LOAN, LESS (C) ALL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF RH AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO A BLOCKED ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT, TO (II) CONSOLIDATED EBITDA OF RH AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE \\u201cNET SENIOR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO\\u201d).  \\u25cf  THE NET SENIOR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO MAY NOT EXCEED 3.50 TO 1.00 AS OF THE LAST DAY OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER. THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS A CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO GENERALLY BASED ON THE SAME FORMULATION SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT SUCH THAT THE BORROWER MAY NOT MAKE CERTAIN \\u201cRESTRICTED PAYMENTS\\u201d IN THE EVENT THAT THE RATIO OF (I) CONSOLIDATED EBITDA MINUS CERTAIN COSTS TO THE AMOUNT OF (II) DEBT SERVICE COSTS PLUS CERTAIN OTHER COSTS IS NOT LESS THAN 1.00 TO 1.00 AND THE LEVEL OF UNUSED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT MEETS CERTAIN LEVELS.  THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND OTHER CUSTOMARY TERMS AND CONDITIONS TYPICAL TO A SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT.  ON MAY 31, 2019, RESTORATION HARDWARE, INC. ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cFIRST AMENDMENT\\u201d). THE FIRST AMENDMENT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AMENDS THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT TO (A) REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT TO DELIVER MONTHLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO THE LENDERS FOR THE LAST FISCAL MONTH OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER AND (B) WAIVE ANY DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT RELATING TO THE DELIVERY OF MONTHLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR OTHER INFORMATION TO LENDERS FOR THE FISCAL MONTHS ENDING FEBRUARY 2019 AND MARCH 2019.  AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $200.0 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND NO AVAILABILITY UNDER THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE AND AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS GENERALLY IN LINE WITH THE COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING REQUIRED FINANCIAL REPORTING, LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY TO INCUR LIENS, MAKE LOANS OR OTHER INVESTMENTS, INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OR INTO ANOTHER PERSON, SELL ASSETS, PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS, OR ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, ALONG WITH OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS TYPICAL TO CREDIT AGREEMENTS OF A SIMILAR TYPE AND SIZE. AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, RESTORATION HARDWARE, INC. WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE COVENANTS OF THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT.  INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT  ON APRIL 10, 2019, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT, RESTORATION HARDWARE, INC. ENTERED INTO AN INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cINTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT\\u201d), DATED AS OF APRIL 9, 2019 AND EFFECTIVE AS OF APRIL 10, 2019, WITH THE FIRST LIEN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE SECOND LIEN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT ESTABLISHES VARIOUS CUSTOMARY INTER-LENDER TERMS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WITH RESPECT TO PRIORITY OF LIENS, PERMITTED ACTIONS BY EACH PARTY, APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS, EXERCISE OF REMEDIES IN CASE OF DEFAULT, RELEASES OF LIENS AND CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE AMENDMENT OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE SECOND LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE OTHER PARTY.  64  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EQUIPMENT LOAN FACILITY  ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2017, RESTORATION HARDWARE, INC. ENTERED INTO A MASTER LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH BANC OF AMERICA LEASING & CAPITAL, LLC (\\u201cBAL\\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH BAL AND WE AGREED THAT BAL WOULD FINANCE CERTAIN EQUIPMENT OF OURS FROM TIME TO TIME, WITH EACH SUCH EQUIPMENT FINANCING TO BE EVIDENCED BY AN EQUIPMENT SECURITY NOTE SETTING FORTH THE TERMS FOR EACH PARTICULAR EQUIPMENT LOAN. EACH EQUIPMENT LOAN IS SECURED BY A PURCHASE MONEY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE FINANCED EQUIPMENT. AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, WE HAD $64.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE EQUIPMENT SECURITY NOTES, OF WHICH $21.5 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND $42.5 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER NON-CURRENT OBLIGATIONS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE MATURITY DATES OF THE EQUIPMENT SECURITY NOTES VARY, BUT GENERALLY HAVE A MATURITY OF THREE OR FOUR YEARS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE MONTHLY INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS UNDER THE EQUIPMENT SECURITY NOTES.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  WE REGULARLY REVIEW SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY AND CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER AND WHEN TO EXECUTE SHARE REPURCHASES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, CURRENT CASH NEEDS, CAPACITY FOR LEVERAGE, COST OF BORROWINGS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF THE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN EXCELLENT ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL FOR THE LONG-TERM BENEFIT OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. WE MAY UNDERTAKE OTHER REPURCHASE PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE WITH RESPECT TO OUR SECURITIES.  $300 MILLION REPURCHASE PROGRAM (COMPLETED)  ON FEBRUARY 21, 2017, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO $300 MILLION (THE \\u201c$300 MILLION REPURCHASE PROGRAM\\u201d) THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHER MEANS, INCLUDING THROUGH RULE 10B18 OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES, RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS OR THROUGH THE USE OF OTHER TECHNIQUES SUCH AS ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASES.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS DESCRIBED IN THE  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\u2014CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  IN THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO MATERIAL OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES, AS WELL AS THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ON-GOING BASIS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT OR COMPLEXITY AND ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO REPORTING OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION, AND ARE THEREFORE DISCUSSED AS CRITICAL.  \\u25cf  REVENUE RECOGNITION  \\u25cf  MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES  \\u25cf  IMPAIRMENT  \\u25cf  LEASE ACCOUNTING  \\u25cf  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  \\u25cf  INCOME TAXES  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE 2016-02\\u2014  LEASES  . THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD RESULTED IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE \\u201cLEASE ACCOUNTING\\u201d CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY IN FISCAL 2019. PLEASE REFER BELOW FOR OUR UPDATED \\u201cLEASE ACCOUNTING\\u201d CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES LISTED ABOVE FROM THE DISCLOSURES INCLUDED IN THE 2018 FORM 10-K. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THESE POLICIES, REFER TO  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \\u2014  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  LEASE ACCOUNTING  WE LEASE NEARLY ALL OF OUR RETAIL AND OUTLET STORE LOCATIONS, CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, DISTRIBUTION AND HOME DELIVERY FACILITIES, AS WELL AS OTHER STORAGE AND OFFICE SPACE. THE INITIAL LEASE TERMS OF OUR REAL ESTATE LEASES GENERALLY RANGE FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS, AND CERTAIN LEASES CONTAIN RENEWAL OPTIONS FOR UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 25 YEARS, THE EXERCISE OF WHICH IS AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION. IN RECOGNIZING THE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES, WE UTILIZE THE LEASE TERM FOR WHICH WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE. WE ALSO LEASE CERTAIN EQUIPMENT WITH LEASE TERMS GENERALLY RANGING FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS. OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT CONTAIN ANY MATERIAL RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS OR COVENANTS.  LEASES, OR LEASE EXTENSIONS, WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AND WE RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE FOR THESE LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  66  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ACCOUNT FOR LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT FOR REAL ESTATE LEASES, AND FOR ALL OTHER ASSET CLASSES WE ACCOUNT FOR THE COMPONENTS SEPARATELY. WE DETERMINE THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE LEASE AND ANY RELATED FINANCING EXPENSES UPON THE LEASE\\u2019S COMMENCEMENT, WHICH FOR REAL ESTATE LEASES IS GENERALLY UPON STORE OPENING OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, WHEN WE TAKE POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF THE ASSET.  AS MOST OF OUR LEASES DO NOT INCLUDE AN IMPLICIT INTEREST RATE, WE DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR EACH LEASE BASED UPON THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE (\\u201cIBR\\u201d) IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE. THE IBR IS COMPUTED AS THE RATE OF INTEREST THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO (I) BORROW ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS (II) OVER A SIMILAR TERM (III) AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE TOTAL LEASE PAYMENTS AND (IV) IN A SIMILAR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. WE UTILIZE OUR ASSET BASED CREDIT FACILITY AS THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE APPLICABLE IBR FOR EACH LEASE.  CERTAIN OF OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF RETAIL SALES OVER CONTRACTUAL LEVELS. DUE TO THE VARIABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF SUCH PAYMENTS, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY RELATED TO SUCH PAYMENTS. ESTIMATED VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  WE HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF LEASES THAT INCLUDE RENTAL PAYMENTS PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION (E.G., BASED ON THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX). WE INCLUDE THESE VARIABLE PAYMENTS IN THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY IF SUCH INCREASES HAVE A MINIMUM RENT ESCALATION (E.G., FLOOR). HOWEVER, WE EXCLUDE THESE VARIABLE PAYMENTS FROM THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY IN THE CASE OF LEASE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT SPECIFY A MINIMUM RENT ESCALATION.  WE RENT OR SUBLEASE CERTAIN REAL ESTATE TO THIRD PARTIES UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND RECOGNIZE RENTAL INCOME RECEIVED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  LEASE ARRANGEMENTS MAY REQUIRE THE LANDLORD TO PROVIDE TENANT ALLOWANCES DIRECTLY TO US. STANDARD TENANT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS, TYPICALLY THOSE RECEIVED UNDER OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS, ARE RECORDED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH AN OFFSET RECORDED IN LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TENANT ALLOWANCES ARE PROVIDED FOR US TO DESIGN AND BUILD THE LEASED ASSET. TENANT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF A LEASED ASSET AND PRIOR TO LEASE COMMENCEMENT ARE RECORDED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH AN OFFSET RECORDED IN OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS (TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE INCURRED RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE FOR CONSTRUCTION COSTS) OR IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES (TO THE EXTENT THAT PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED PRIOR TO CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES BY US) ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AFTER THE LEASED ASSET IS CONSTRUCTED AND THE LEASE COMMENCES, WE RECLASSIFY THE TENANT ALLOWANCE FROM OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES TO LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  LEASE CLASSIFICATION  CERTAIN OF OUR REAL ESTATE AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE HELD UNDER FINANCE LEASES. LEASE RELATED ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS WITHIN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  \\u2014NET  ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  LEASES THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A FINANCE LEASE ARE CONSIDERED OPERATING LEASES. LEASE RELATED ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  CONSTRUCTION RELATED ACTIVITIES  WE ARE SOMETIMES INVOLVED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEASED STORES FOR CERTAIN OF OUR NEWER DESIGN GALLERIES. PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION COMMENCEMENT, WE EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT WE, AS LESSEE, CONTROL THE ASSET BEING CONSTRUCTED AND, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, MAY BE THE \\u201cDEEMED OWNER\\u201d OF THE LEASED ASSET FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD.  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IF WE ARE NOT THE \\u201cDEEMED OWNER\\u201d FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD, SUCH LEASE IS CLASSIFIED AS EITHER AN OPERATING OR FINANCE LEASE UPON LEASE COMMENCEMENT. DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD AND PRIOR TO LEASE COMMENCEMENT, ANY CAPITAL AMOUNTS CONTRIBUTED BY US TOWARD THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LEASED ASSET (EXCLUDING NORMAL LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED WITHIN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\\u2014NET) ARE RECORDED AS \\u201cLANDLORD ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION\\u201d WITHIN OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (REFER TO NOTE 3\\u2014  PREPAID EXPENSE AND OTHER ASSETS  ). UPON COMPLETION OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, AND UPON LEASE COMMENCEMENT, WE RECLASSIFY AMOUNTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DETERMINED TO BE THE LANDLORD ASSET TO LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS DETERMINED NOT TO BE PART OF THE LEASED ASSET ARE CLASSIFIED AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\\u2014NET ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  IF WE ARE THE \\u201cDEEMED OWNER\\u201d FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, UPON COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO CAPITALIZE (I) COSTS INCURRED BY US AND (II) THE CASH AND NON-CASH ASSETS CONTRIBUTED BY THE LANDLORD FOR CONSTRUCTION AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ON ITS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS BUILD-TO-SUIT ASSETS, WITH AN OFFSETTING FINANCING OBLIGATION FOR THE AMOUNT FUNDED BY THE LANDLORD. THE CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE LANDLORD TOWARD CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING THE BUILDING, EXISTING SITE IMPROVEMENTS AT CONSTRUCTION COMMENCEMENT AND ANY AMOUNTS PAID BY THE LANDLORD TO THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTION, ARE INCLUDED AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS DUE TO BUILD-TO-SUIT LEASE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE NON-CASH SECTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. OVER THE LEASE TERM, THESE NON-CASH ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT DO NOT IMPACT OUR CASH OUTFLOWS, NOR DO THEY IMPACT NET INCOME WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  UPON COMPLETION OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, WE PERFORM A SALE-LEASEBACK ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF WE CAN DERECOGNIZE THE BUILD-TO-SUIT ASSET AND CORRESPONDING FINANCING OBLIGATION. IF THE ASSET AND LIABILITY CANNOT BE DERECOGNIZED, WE ACCOUNT FOR THE AGREEMENT AS A DEBT-LIKE ARRANGEMENT.  \\u200b  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO NOTE 2\\u2014  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY PROPOSED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"RH\", \"CIK\": 1528849, \"Date\": \"2019-09-11T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"RH\", \"Name\": \"Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NYSE\", \"SIC\": 5712.0, \"Business\": \"CA\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 453052669.0, \"key\": \"20190911RH\", \"labelr1\": 1.2997903563941395, \"labelr2\": 2.6667455061494745, \"labelr3\": -2.3440649657317247, \"labelr4\": 1.8695447039396007, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5605939, \"prof1\": 0.43940607, \"return1&2\": 0.9606812623837491, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9832002552876355, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.9648188869857852, \"return2\": 0.9733325449385052, \"return1\": 0.9870020964360586, \"return3\": 1.0234406496573172, \"return4\": 0.981304552960604, \"1_day_return\": 1.299790356394137, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.017220275559030208, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": -0.0, \"indexx\": 2399, \"returnpred\": -1.2997903563941395, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.0037064669649214, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.7675463329229708, \"cumreturn1c\": 1.0129528876033214, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0355438576901401, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0407546095421445}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 2410, \"level_0\": 2472, \"index\": 5523, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

IN DECEMBER 2017, WE ACQUIRED OUTWARD, INC., A 3-D IMAGING AND AUGMENTED REALITY PLATFORM FOR THE HOME FURNISHINGS AND DE\\u0301COR INDUSTRY.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019\\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED JULY 29, 2018 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018\\u201d) AND THE TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 (\\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2019\\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED JULY 29, 2018 (\\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2018\\u201d), SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO. ALL EXPLANATIONS OF CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS  NET REVENUES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCREASED BY $95,640,000, OR 7.5%, COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WITH COMPARABLE BRAND REVENUE GROWTH OF 6.5%. THIS GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WEST ELM, POTTERY BARN AND POTTERY BARN KIDS AND TEEN. NET REVENUE GROWTH INCLUDED AN 8.7% INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR FRANCHISE OPERATIONS.  WEST ELM HAD A STRONG QUARTER WITH COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH ACCELERATING TO 17.5%, ON TOP OF 9.5% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THESE RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY STRONG EXECUTION ACROSS ALL OUR KEY GROWTH STRATEGIES. IN POTTERY BARN, COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH ACCELERATED TO 4.2% AND CONTINUED TO BE LED BY FURNITURE, WITH STRENGTH IN OUR PROPRIETARY UPHOLSTERY BUSINESS. IN POTTERY BARN KIDS AND TEEN, COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH WAS 3.7%. OUR BABY BUSINESS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT GROWTH INITIATIVE, AND DURING THE QUARTER, WE SAW SIGNIFICANT GROWTH ACROSS OUR BACK-TO-SCHOOL OFFERINGS AND FOUNDATIONAL FURNITURE CATEGORIES. OUR EMERGING BRANDS, REJUVENATION AND MARK & GRAHAM DROVE ANOTHER QUARTER OF SOLID GROWTH. IN THE WILLIAMS SONOMA BRAND, WHILE WE ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 1.1% COMPARABLE REVENUE DECLINE THIS QUARTER, WE DID HAVE COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH IN OUR FULL-PRICE BUSINESS AND NEW INTRODUCTIONS WERE SOLID. HOWEVER, THEY WEREN\\u2019T STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE CLEARANCE VOLUME, MISSES IN TABLETOP AND THE VERY SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF INSTANT POT LAST YEAR. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WAS $0.79 (WHICH INCLUDED A $0.07 IMPACT RELATED TO OUTWARD, INC., AND A $0.01 IMPACT FROM EMPLOYMENT-RELATED EXPENSES) VERSUS $0.62 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 (WHICH INCLUDED A $0.05 IMPACT RELATED TO OUTWARD, INC., A $0.05 IMPACT RELATED TO IMPAIRMENT AND EARLY LEASE TERMINATION CHARGES, A $0.03 IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH TAX EXPENSE FROM U.S. TAX REFORM, AND A $0.02 IMPACT FROM EMPLOYMENT-RELATED EXPENSES). WE ALSO RETURNED $76,868,000 TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.  OPERATIONALLY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ALSO MADE PROGRESS ACROSS OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF DRIVING GROWTH THROUGH CROSS-BRAND INITIATIVES AND IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS.  A KEY DRIVER OF OUR ACCELERATED GROWTH THIS QUARTER WAS THE FOCUS ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS. THE KEY CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPACTFUL DRIVER OF CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT AND REVENUE GROWTH AS TOTAL MEMBERSHIP CONTINUED TO GROW DURING THE QUARTER. OUR CROSS-BRAND BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS DIVISION ALSO DELIVERED STRONG GROWTH THIS QUARTER AND WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY WORKING TO PUT IN PLACE THE CROSS-BRAND, CROSS-FUNCTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH, AS WELL AS EXPANDING OUR LARGE-SCALE PROJECT PIPELINE WITH MORE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS INDUSTRY VERTICALS.  ALSO, DURING THE QUARTER, WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. IN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED OUR TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION AGENDA WITH THE LAUNCH OF MANY NEW CAPABILITIES OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, ACROSS EACH OF OUR BRANDS, TO DELIVER MORE ENGAGING, CONTENT-RICH CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES. IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THIS QUARTER, WE LAUNCHED FURNITURE DELIVERY SCHEDULING CAPABILITY WHICH GIVES CUSTOMERS THE OPTION TO SCHEDULE THEIR DELIVERY ON THEIR MOBILE DEVICES. WE ADDED FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS SUCH AS EMAIL AND MOBILE NOTIFICATIONS TO OUR ORDER TRACKING CAPABILITY LAUNCHED IN THE FIRST QUARTER. AND, IN THE SECOND QUARTER, WE SUCCESSFULLY OPENED OUR WEST ELM WEST COAST DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN FONTANA, CALIFORNIA, WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN SEPTEMBER. AND FINALLY, OUR IN-HOUSE MANUFACTURING OPERATION CONTINUES TO BE A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR US, WHERE SHIPMENTS ARE UP 30% YEAR-OVER-YEAR AS WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS TO ENABLE MORE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION, WHICH HELPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CHINA TARIFFS.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 WE PLAN TO DRIVE CROSS-BRAND INITIATIVES THAT LEVERAGE OUR PLATFORM, AND WE PLAN TO BRING TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT THE EXECUTION OF OUR INITIATIVES THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 AND BEYOND, AS WELL AS TO DELIVER LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE PROVISIONAL TRANSITION TAX AND THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES UNDER SAB 118 IN THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018.

AS IS CONSISTENT WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY, OUR CASH BALANCES ARE SEASONAL IN NATURE, WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER HISTORICALLY REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LEVEL OF CASH THAN OTHER PERIODS.  IN FISCAL 2019, WE PLAN TO USE OUR CASH RESOURCES TO FUND OUR INVENTORY AND INVENTORY RELATED PURCHASES, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING INITIATIVES, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES, STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.

THE REVOLVER MAY BE USED TO BORROW REVOLVING LOANS OR REQUEST THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. WE MAY, UPON NOTICE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, REQUEST EXISTING OR NEW LENDERS TO INCREASE THE REVOLVER BY UP TO $250,000,000, AT SUCH LENDERS\\u2019 OPTION, TO PROVIDE FOR A TOTAL OF $750,000,000 OF UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT. FOR YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2019, WE HAD BORROWINGS OF $60,000,000 UNDER THE REVOLVER. FOR YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2018, WE HAD NO BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER. AS OF AUGUST 4, 2019, WE HAD $300,000,000 OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR TERM LOAN. THE TERM LOAN MATURES ON JANUARY 8, 2021, AT WHICH POINT ALL OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND ANY ACCRUED INTEREST MUST BE REPAID.

THESE LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITIES REPRESENT ONLY A FUTURE COMMITMENT TO FUND INVENTORY PURCHASES TO WHICH WE HAVE NOT TAKEN LEGAL TITLE. ON AUGUST 23, 2019, WE RENEWED ALL THREE OF OUR LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITIES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TERMS.  WE ARE CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND, BASED ON OUR CURRENT PROJECTIONS, WE EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE THROUGHOUT THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE BELIEVE OUR CASH ON HAND, IN ADDITION TO OUR AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY FOR OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FOR YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2019, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $26,636,000 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $120,123,000 FOR YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2018. FOR YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2019, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS.

THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OTHER THAN THOSE DISCUSSED IN NOTES H, I AND M TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2019.  SEASONALITY  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN DEMAND. HISTORICALLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REALIZED DURING THE PERIOD FROM OCTOBER THROUGH JANUARY, AND LEVELS OF NET REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN LOWER DURING THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY THROUGH SEPTEMBER. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE GENERAL PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. IN PREPARATION FOR AND DURING OUR HOLIDAY SELLING SEASON, WE HIRE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES, PRIMARILY IN OUR RETAIL STORES, CUSTOMER CARE CENTERS AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT FIXED CATALOG PRODUCTION AND MAILING COSTS.\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"WILLIAMS SONOMA INC\", \"CIK\": 719955, \"Date\": \"2019-09-12T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"WSM\", \"Name\": \"Williams Sonoma Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NYSE\", \"SIC\": 5700.0, \"Business\": \"CA\", \"Incorporated\": \"CA\", \"IRS\": 942203880.0, \"key\": \"20190912WSM\", \"labelr1\": 1.085340469818599, \"labelr2\": -0.9118988086483164, \"labelr3\": -0.26718123793974585, \"labelr4\": -2.8426849233516838, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.55967635, \"prof1\": 0.4403237, \"return1&2\": 0.9981666113201568, \"return1&2&3\": 1.0008335252289828, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.0292840689585163, \"return2\": 1.0091189880864833, \"return1\": 0.989146595301814, \"return3\": 1.0026718123793974, \"return4\": 1.0284268492335171, \"1_day_return\": 1.0853404698186075, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.011060327382770208, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": -0.0, \"indexx\": 2410, \"returnpred\": -1.085340469818599, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9545864886529916, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.7326893588234188, \"cumreturn1c\": 1.0019905235480226, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0347936951157761, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0421739480932932}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 2414, \"level_0\": 2476, \"index\": 59072, \"text\": \"ITEM 2  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  20\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"BUTLER NATIONAL CORP\", \"CIK\": 15847, \"Date\": \"2019-09-13T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"BUKS\", \"Name\": \"Butler National Corp\", \"Exchange\": \"OTC\", \"SIC\": 7990.0, \"Business\": \"KS\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 410834293.0, \"key\": \"20190913BUKS\", \"labelr1\": 0.0, \"labelr2\": 0.0, \"labelr3\": 0.0, \"labelr4\": -4.651162790697677, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.62309635, \"prof1\": 0.37690359999999995, \"return1&2\": 1.0, \"return1&2&3\": 1.0, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.0465116279069768, \"return2\": 1.0, \"return1\": 1.0, \"return3\": 1.0, \"return4\": 1.0465116279069768, \"1_day_return\": 0.0, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.011873228839211051, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": -0.0, \"indexx\": 2414, \"returnpred\": -0.0, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.020669292446046, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.747833529453046, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9995754683628351, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0315490096821769, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0367103172145955}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 2415, \"level_0\": 2477, \"index\": 68365, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW  WE  ARE ENGAGED IN THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF HOTEL PROPERTIES. AT JULY 31, 2019, THE TRUST HAD TWO MODERATE -SERVICE HOTELS IN  TUCSON, ARIZONA AND ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO WITH 267 HOTEL SUITES, AND MANAGED A THIRD HOTEL IN TEMPE, ARIZONA. BOTH OF OUR HOTELS  ARE BRANDED THROUGH MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH BEST WESTERN, AND BOTH ARE TRADEMARKED AS INNSUITES HOTELS. WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED  IN VARIOUS OPERATIONS INCIDENTAL TO THE OPERATION OF HOTELS, SUCH AS THE OPERATION OF RESTAURANTS AND MEETING/BANQUET ROOM RENTALS.  AT JULY 31, 2019, WE OWNED, THROUGH OUR SOLE  GENERAL PARTNER\\u2019S INTEREST IN THE PARTNERSHIP, A DIRECT 20.53% INTEREST IN THE ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO HOTEL, AND, TOGETHER  WITH THE PARTNERSHIP, OWNED AN INDIRECT 51.01% INTEREST IN THE TUCSON, ARIZONA. HOTEL.  OUR  OPERATIONS CONSIST OF ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT \\u2013 HOTEL OPERATIONS & HOTEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES. HOTEL OPERATIONS DERIVES  ITS REVENUE FROM THE OPERATION OF THE TRUST\\u2019S TWO HOTEL PROPERTIES WITH AN AGGREGATE OF 267 SUITES IN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO.  HOTEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, PROVIDES MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THE TRUST\\u2019S TWO HOTELS AND A NON-OWNED HOTEL IN TEMPE, ARIZONA.  AS PART OF OUR MANAGEMENT SERVICES, WE ALSO PROVIDE TRADEMARK AND LICENSING SERVICES.  28  OUR  RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OCCUPANCY AND ROOM RATES AT THE HOTELS, OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS, CHANGES IN ROOM RATES,  AND CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE SUITES CAUSED BY THE TRUST\\u2019S DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES. RESULTS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY  IMPACTED BY OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD NEGATIVELY  IMPACT HOTEL ROOM DEMAND AND PRICING, WHICH WOULD REDUCE OUR PROFIT MARGINS ON RENTED SUITES. ADDITIONALLY, OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE  COSTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES, RESULTING IN LOWER OPERATING MARGINS AND HIGHER  HOURLY LABOR COSTS. EITHER A FURTHER INCREASE IN SUPPLY OR A FURTHER DECLINE IN DEMAND COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION,  WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE RATES AND REVENUE OF THE HOTELS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.  WE  ARE EXPERIENCING SLIGHTLY STRONGER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019. WE  ANTICIPATE THAT THIS ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE DURING FISCAL 2020. WE EXPECT THE MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 TO BE THE CONTINUATION  OF STRONG COMPETITION FOR CORPORATE LEISURE GROUP AND GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH MAY AFFECT  OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE ROOM RATES WHILE MAINTAINING MARKET SHARE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE POSITIONED THE HOTELS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE  THROUGH REFURBISHMENT, BY OFFERING A RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF TWO-ROOM SUITES AT EACH LOCATION, AND BY MAINTAINING A ROBUST  COMPLEMENTARY GUEST ITEMS AND A FREE INTERNET ACCESS SYSTEM.  OUR  STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO OBTAIN THE FULL BENEFIT OF OUR REAL ESTATE EQUITY, BY MARKETING THE HOTELS AT ATTRACTIVE CURRENT PRICES.  IN ADDITION, THE TRUST IS SEEKING A PUBLIC, OR LARGE PRIVATE MERGER PARTNER THAT MAY BENEFIT FROM A MERGER THAT WOULD AFFORD  THAT PARTNER ACCESS TO OUR LISTING ON THE NYSE AMERICAN.

HOTEL  PROPERTY DEPRECIATION EXPENSES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $44,000, OR 21.1%, FROM APPROXIMATELY $209,000 REPORTED FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $253,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. INCREASED DEPRECIATION  IS RESULTS FROM THE CAPITALIZATION OF THE PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO.  33  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  \\u2013 HOTEL OPERATIONS & CORPORATE OVERHEAD  OUR  PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, IS OUR SHARE OF THE PARTNERSHIP\\u2019S  CASH FLOW OF THE TUCSON HOTEL, QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO PROPERTIES, MANAGEMENT FEES EARNED IN  THE OPERATION OF THE TRUSTS\\u2019 TWO HOTELS PLUS ONE AFFILIATED HOTEL, AND THE SALE OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTY IN YUMA, ARIZONA,  AS WELL AS POTENTIAL FUTURE HOTEL SALES. THE PARTNERSHIP\\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF REVENUE IS HOTEL OPERATIONS FOR THE ONE HOTEL  PROPERTY IT OWNS IN TUCSON, ARIZONA. OUR LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, WILL DEPEND  UPON OUR ABILITY, AND THE PARTNERSHIP\\u2019S ABILITY, TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FROM HOTEL OPERATIONS AND TO SERVICE OUR  DEBT.  HOTEL  OPERATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OCCUPANCY AND ROOM RATES AT THE HOTELS. WE ANTICIPATE OCCUPANCY AND ADR WILL CONTINUE  TO GROW MODERATELY DURING THIS COMING YEAR AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.  WITH APPROXIMATELY  $2,101,000 OF CASH AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND THE AVAILABILITY OF A $150,000 BANK LINE OF CREDIT, A $1,000,000  RELATED PARTY DEMAND/REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT/PROMISSORY NOTE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR TWO AVAILABLE ADVANCES TO AFFILIATE  CREDIT FACILITIES FOR A TOTAL OF $1,000,000 MAXIMUM BORROWING CAPACITY, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH CASH ON HAND TO MEET  ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE ISSUANCE DATE OF THE THESE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR MANAGEMENT IS ANALYZING OTHER STRATEGIC OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US, INCLUDING RAISING ADDITIONAL  FUNDS, ADDITIONAL ASSET SALES, INCREASING BORROWINGS AT EITHER, OR BOTH, THE ALBUQUERQUE AND TUCSON HOTELS AND USING THE FUNDS  GENERATED TO PAY INTERCOMPANY LOANS (1) DUE FROM THE TUCSON HOTEL TO THE PARTNERSHIP OF APPROXIMATELY $3.2 MILLION, AND  (2) DUE FROM THE ALBUQUERQUE HOTEL DUE TO THE TRUST OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION (3) AND OTHER DUE FROM AFFILIATES; HOWEVER,  SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL.  THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN REFINANCING DEBT OR RAISING ADDITIONAL OR REPLACEMENT FUNDS, OR THAT THESE FUNDS  MAY BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL OR REPLACEMENT FUNDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED  TO SELL CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WHICH MAY NOT BE ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE.  WE  ANTICIPATE SOME ADDITIONAL NEW-BUILD HOTEL SUPPLY DURING THE REMAINING FISCAL YEAR 2020, AND ACCORDINGLY WE ANTICIPATE SOME ADDITIONAL  PRESSURE ON REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS. WE EXPECT THE MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR THE UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR TO BE THE CONTINUATION  OF STRONG COMPETITION FOR CORPORATE, LEISURE, GROUP, AND GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH MAY AFFECT  OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE ROOM RATES WHILE MAINTAINING MARKET SHARE.  NET  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $410,000 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY  31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO NET CASH USED OF APPROXIMATELY $616,000 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. CONSOLIDATED NET LOSS  WAS APPROXIMATELY $760,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO CONSOLIDATED NET LOSS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2018 OF APPROXIMATELY $947,000.

HOTEL PROPERTY DEPRECIATION WAS APPROXIMATELY $495,000 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $414,000  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $81,000 AS THE TRUST RECOGNIZED LESS DEPRECIATION  AS ONE OF THE HOTEL PROPERTIES WAS SOLD DURING THE FISCAL YEAR 2019.  34  CHANGES IN ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY  $650,000 AND APPROXIMATELY ($424,000) FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE  IN CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 WAS  DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OPERATING LIABILITIES RELATED TO ONGOING OPERATIONS.  NET CASH PROVIDED  BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $219,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN INVESTING  ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.4 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS DUE TO THE NO ACTIVITY FOR NET COLLECTIONS AND LENDING ON ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES  \\u2013 RELATED PARTY DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO A NET INFLOW OF APPROXIMATELY $170,000 FOR  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OCCURRED IN THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS WE REDEEMED APPROXIMATELY $410,000 OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019, VERSUS CASHED USED IN THE LARGE PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.  NET  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $764,000 AND $909,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018. THE DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $145,000 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASES IN REPURCHASES OF TREASURY STOCK AND  DISTRIBUTIONS TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST HOLDERS AND DECREASES IN NET PAYMENTS ON NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS.  PRINCIPAL  PAYMENTS ON MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLES FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY $57,000 AND $252,000 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. NET PAYMENTS AND BORROWINGS ON NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS WAS APPROXIMATELY ($9,300) AND APPROXIMATELY  $-0- DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

COLLECTIONS ON OTHER  NOTES PAYABLES NETTED AGAINST BORROWINGS ON OTHER NOTE PAYABLE WAS APPROXIMATELY ($543,000) AND ($26,000) OF NET CASH USED  IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  PROCEEDS  FROM SALES OF NON-CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $86,000 AS SALES OF NON-CONTROLLING  OWNERSHIP INTEREST WAS -0- FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND APPROXIMATELY $86,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2018. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, WE PRIMARILY SOLD ADDITIONAL NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OUR YUMA, ARIZONA AND  ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO PROPERTY SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAD NO SALES OF OUR IHT STOCK FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JULY 31, 2019, OUR DISTRIBUTIONS TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST HOLDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY $200,000 COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY  $454,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.  WE CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO A CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FUND (THE \\u201cFUND\\u201d) AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 4% OF THE INNSUITES HOTELS\\u2019 REVENUES FROM OPERATION OF THE HOTELS. THE  FUND IS RESTRICTED BY THE MORTGAGE LENDER FOR ONE OF OUR PROPERTIES. AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, THERE WERE NO MONIES HELD IN  THESE ACCOUNTS REPORTED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS \\u201cRESTRICTED CASH.\\u201d THE FUND IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HOTELS AND REFURBISHMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT. DURING THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, THE HOTELS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $190,000 AND $516,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS AT THE HOTELS, AS REQUIRED TO MEET CONTINUING BEST  WESTERN STANDARDS. WE CONSIDER THE MAJORITY OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO BE REVENUE PRODUCING. THEREFORE, THESE AMOUNTS ARE CAPITALIZED  AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. FOR THE REMAINING FISCAL YEAR 2020 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WE PLAN ON SPENDING  LESS ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AS WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS AT OUR TUCSON, ARIZONA HOTEL WHICH REQUIRED SIGNIFICANT  AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDING JULY 31, 2019. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE WERE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS  INCURRED AND APPROXIMATED $202,000 AND $196,000 FOR CONTINUED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  35  WE  HAVE MINIMUM DEBT PAYMENTS, NET OF DEBT DISCOUNTS, OF APPROXIMATELY $921,000 AND APPROXIMATELY $484,000 DUE DURING FISCAL YEARS  2020 AND 2021, RESPECTIVELY. MINIMUM DEBT PAYMENTS DUE DURING FISCAL YEAR 2020 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $57,000 OF MORTGAGE NOTES  PAYABLE, APPROXIMATELY $159,000 FOR RELATED PARTY NOTES PAYABLE, AND APPROXIMATELY $705,000 OF OTHER NOTES PAYABLE WHICH ARE SECURED  PROMISSORY NOTES OUTSTANDING TO UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM THE SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST AND PARTNERSHIP UNIT REPURCHASES.  WE  MAY SEEK TO NEGOTIATE ADDITIONAL CREDIT FACILITIES OR ISSUE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. ANY DEBT INCURRED OR ISSUED BY US MAY BE SECURED  OR UNSECURED, LONG-TERM, MEDIUM-TERM OR SHORT-TERM, BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED OR VARIABLE RATE AND BE SUBJECT TO SUCH OTHER TERMS  AS WE CONSIDER PRUDENT.  COMPETITION  IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY  THE  HOTEL INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT THE MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020 (\\u201cFISCAL  YEAR 2020\\u201d) TO BE THE CONTINUATION OF COMPETITION FOR CORPORATE LEISURE GROUP AND GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IN THE MARKETS IN  WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE ROOM RATES WHILE MAINTAINING MARKET SHARE. EACH OF THE HOTELS, AND  THE TEMPE HOTEL FACES COMPETITION PRIMARILY FROM OTHER MID-MARKET HOTELS LOCATED IN ITS IMMEDIATE VICINITY, BUT ALSO COMPETES  WITH HOTEL PROPERTIES LOCATED IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, AND INCREASINGLY FROM ALTERNATIVE LODGING FACILITIES, SUCH AS AIRBNB.  WHILE NONE OF THE HOTELS\\u2019 COMPETITORS DOMINATE ANY OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, SOME OF THOSE COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER  MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN THE TRUST.  CERTAIN  ADDITIONAL HOTEL PROPERTY REFURBISHMENTS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN COMPLETED BY COMPETITORS IN BOTH OF THE HOTELS\\u2019 MARKETS, AND  ADDITIONAL HOTEL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS MAY BE BUILT IN THE FUTURE. SUCH HOTEL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE HAD, AND COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE,  AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE REVENUE OF OUR HOTELS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.  THE  TRUST\\u2019S HOTEL INVESTMENTS ARE LOCATED IN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO. WITH THE COMPLETED RENOVATIONS AT OUR TUCSON, ARIZONA AND  ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO HOTEL PROPERTIES, THOSE HOTELS HAVE SEEN ADDITIONAL DEMAND AS SUPPLY HAS BEEN STEADY IN THOSE RESPECTIVE  MARKETS. EITHER AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY OR A DECLINE IN DEMAND COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OCCUPANCY, ROOM RATES AND REVENUES OF OUR HOTELS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.  THE  TRUST MAY ALSO COMPETE FOR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES. THESE ENTITIES  ALSO MAY GENERALLY ACCEPT MORE RISK THAN THE TRUST CAN PRUDENTLY MANAGE. COMPETITION MAY GENERALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SUITABLE  FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THE TRUST AND INCREASE THE BARGAINING POWER OF OWNERS SEEKING TO SELL THEIR PROPERTIES.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN  OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 FILED WITH THE SEC ON JUNE 19, 2019, WE IDENTIFIED THE  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT AFFECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN PREPARING OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POLICIES WE FOLLOW FOR THE VALUATION OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY  OF OUR ASSETS, ARE OUR MOST CRITICAL POLICIES WHICH HAS NOT CHANGED IN THE PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THOSE POLICIES INCLUDE  METHODS USED TO RECOGNIZE AND MEASURE ANY IDENTIFIED IMPAIRMENT OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTY ASSETS.  36  ASSET  IMPAIRMENT  WE  BELIEVE THAT THE POLICIES WE FOLLOW FOR THE VALUATION OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF OUR ASSETS, ARE  OUR MOST CRITICAL POLICIES. THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) HAS ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE RELATED  TO THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, CODIFIED IN ASC TOPIC 360-10-35, WHICH WE APPLY TO DETERMINE WHEN IT IS NECESSARY  TO TEST AN ASSET FOR RECOVERABILITY. ON AN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BASIS, WE REVIEW THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES.  WE WILL RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS AND REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF A PROPERTY WHEN ANTICIPATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS  AND THE CURRENT MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY DO NOT SUPPORT ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN CASES WHERE WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE  CARRYING COST OF HOTEL PROPERTIES HELD FOR USE, WE WILL REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HOTEL, AS DETERMINED  BY A CURRENT APPRAISAL OR OTHER ACCEPTABLE VALUATION METHODS. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE A HOTEL PROPERTIES IMPAIRMENT LOSS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 OR 2018. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, OUR MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ANY OF  OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES ARE IMPAIRED.  SALE  OF HOTEL ASSETS  ON  AUGUST 1, 2015, THE TRUST FINALIZED AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO SELL HOTEL PROPERTIES. THE TRUST LISTED HOTEL PROPERTIES WITH REAL  ESTATE HOTEL BROKERS, EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 24, 2018, THE TRUST SOLD THE YUMA HOTEL TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY FOR $16.05 MILLION,  AND ON JUNE 2, 2017, THE TRUST SOLD ITS ONTARIO, CALIFORNIA HOTEL TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY FOR APPROXIMATELY $17.5 MILLION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT OUR CURRENTLY-OWNED HOTELS ARE LISTED AT PRICES THAT IS REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THEIR CURRENT FAIR  VALUE. THE TRUST BELIEVES THAT THE PLAN TO SELL THESE ASSETS WILL NOT BE WITHDRAWN. THROUGH THE TRUST\\u2019S FORM 10-Q FOR THE  QUARTER ENDED JULY 31, 2017 FILED WITH THE SEC ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2017, THE TRUST CLASSIFIED ALL THE HOTEL PROPERTIES AS ASSETS  HELD FOR SALE. AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2017, THE TRUST HAS DECIDED TO RECLASSIFY THESE ASSETS BACK INTO OPERATIONS AS MANY OF THESE  ASSETS HAVE BEEN MARKETED FOR SALE FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR. AT THIS TIME, THE TRUST IS UNABLE TO PREDICT WHEN, AND IF, ANY OF THESE  HOTEL PROPERTIES WILL BE SOLD AND THE TRUST NO LONGER DEEMS A SALE TO BE PROBABLE. THE TRUST CONTINUES TO LIST THESE PROPERTIES  WITH LOCAL REAL ESTATE HOTEL BROKERS AND, WE BELIEVE, THAT EACH OF THE ASSETS IS BEING MARKETED AT A PRICE THAT IS REASONABLE  IN RELATION TO ITS CURRENT FAIR VALUE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR BASIS OF PRESENTATION SINCE OCTOBER 31,  2017.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  ASU  2014-09 (TOPIC 606), \\u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\\u201d IS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIOD AFTER JANUARY 1, 2018.  ASU 2014-09 REQUIRES ENTITIES TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A FIVE-STEP MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES IDENTIFICATION  OF THE CONTRACT, IDENTIFICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, DETERMINATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE, ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION  PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AS THE ENTITY SATISFIES THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  REVENUES  ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND WHEN COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY  ASSURED. AMOUNTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF REVENUE RECOGNITION ARE CONSIDERED DEFERRED LIABILITIES.  REVENUES  PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ROOM RENTALS, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, MANAGEMENT AND TRADEMARK FEES AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES FROM  OUR PROPERTIES. REVENUES ARE RECORDED WHEN ROOMS ARE OCCUPIED AND WHEN FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES ARE DELIVERED. MANAGEMENT AND TRADEMARK  FEES FROM NON-AFFILIATED HOTELS INCLUDE A MONTHLY ACCOUNTING FEE AND A PERCENTAGE OF HOTEL ROOM REVENUES FOR MANAGING THE DAILY  OPERATIONS OF THE HOTELS AND THE ONE HOTEL OWNED BY AFFILIATES OF MR. WIRTH.  EACH  ROOM NIGHT CONSUMED BY A GUEST WITH A CANCELLABLE RESERVATION REPRESENTS A CONTRACT WHEREBY THE COMPANY HAS A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  TO PROVIDE THE ROOM NIGHT AT AN AGREED UPON PRICE. FOR CANCELLABLE RESERVATIONS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE AS EACH PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION (I.E., EACH ROOM NIGHT) IS MET. SUCH CONTRACT IS RENEWED IF THE GUEST CONTINUES THEIR STAY. FOR ROOM NIGHTS CONSUMED  BY A GUEST WITH A NON-CANCELLABLE RESERVATION, THE ENTIRE RESERVATION PERIOD REPRESENTS THE CONTRACT TERM WHEREBY THE COMPANY  HAS A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE ROOM NIGHT OR NIGHTS AT AN AGREED UPON PRICE. FOR NON-CANCELLABLE RESERVATIONS, THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE OVER THE TERM OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD (I.E., THE RESERVATION PERIOD) AS ROOM NIGHTS ARE CONSUMED.  FOR THESE RESERVATIONS, THE ROOM RATE IS TYPICALLY FIXED OVER THE RESERVATION PERIOD. THE COMPANY USES AN OUTPUT METHOD BASED  ON PERFORMANCE COMPLETED TO DATE (I.E., ROOM NIGHTS CONSUMED) TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE IT RECOGNIZES ON A DAILY BASIS  IF THE LENGTH OF A NON-CANCELLABLE RESERVATION EXCEEDS ONE NIGHT SINCE CONSUMPTION OF ROOM NIGHTS INDICATES WHEN SERVICES ARE  TRANSFERRED TO THE GUEST. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, VARIABLE CONSIDERATION MAY EXIST WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTION PRICE, SUCH AS  DISCOUNTS, COUPONS AND PRICE CONCESSIONS MADE UPON GUEST CHECKOUT.  37  IN  EVALUATING ITS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, THE COMPANY BUNDLES THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE GUEST THE ROOM ITSELF WITH OTHER OBLIGATIONS  (SUCH AS FREE WIFI, GRAB AND GO BREAKFAST, ACCESS TO ON-SITE LAUNDRY FACILITIES AND PARKING), AS THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT  DISTINCT AND SEPARABLE BECAUSE THE GUEST CANNOT BENEFIT FROM THE ADDITIONAL AMENITIES WITHOUT THE CONSUMED ROOM NIGHT. THE COMPANY\\u2019S  OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS OR SERVICES IS NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION  (I.E., PROVIDING THE ROOM AND ITS CONTENTS). THE COMPANY HAS NO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ONCE A GUEST\\u2019S STAY IS COMPLETE.  WE  ARE REQUIRED TO COLLECT CERTAIN TAXES AND FEES FROM CUSTOMERS ON BEHALF OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND REMIT THESE BACK TO THE APPLICABLE  GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES ON A PERIODIC BASIS. WE HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO ACT AS A COLLECTION AGENT. WE DO NOT RETAIN THESE TAXES  AND FEES AND, THEREFORE, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN REVENUES. WE RECORD A LIABILITY WHEN THE AMOUNTS ARE COLLECTED AND RELIEVE THE  LIABILITY WHEN PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY OR OTHER APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY.  COMPLIANCE  WITH CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS OF NYSE AMERICAN  ON  MAY 17, 2019, THE TRUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM NYSE AMERICAN GIVING AN OFFICIAL NOTICE OF NONCOMPLIANCE OF THE TRUST WITH CONTINUED  LISTING STANDARDS OF NYSE AMERICAN LLC (THE \\u201cEXCHANGE\\u201d) BECAUSE THE TRUST FAILED TO TIMELY FILE WITH THE SECURITIES  AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \\u201cSEC\\u201d) ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 (THE \\u201cDELINQUENT  REPORT\\u201d). THIS FILING DELINQUENCY SUBJECTS THE TRUST TO THE PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 1007 OF THE NYSE AMERICAN  COMPANY GUIDE. THE REQUISITE FORM 8-K AND ASSOCIATED PRESS RELEASE WERE ISSUED ON MAY 23, 2019, AND THE TRUST FILED THE ANNUAL  FORM 10-K ON JUNE 19, 2019.  ON JULY 25, 2019, THE TRUST RECEIVED A LETTER  FROM NYSE AMERICAN GIVING OFFICIAL NOTICE THAT THE TRUST IS BACK IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NYSE AMERICAN LLC (THE \\u201cEXCHANGE\\u201d)  CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS SET FORTH IN PART 10 OF THE NYSE AMERICAN COMPANY GUIDE (\\u201cCOMPANY GUIDE\\u201d). SPECIFICALLY,  THE TRUST HAS RESOLVED THE LISTING DEFICIENCY WITH RESPECT TO SECTIONS 134 AND 1101 OF THE COMPANY GUIDE, REFERENCED  IN THE EXCHANGE\\u2019S LETTER OF MAY 17, 2019  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES  THE  FOLLOWING NON-GAAP PRESENTATIONS OF EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\\u201c  EBITDA  \\u201d)  AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\\u201c  FFO  \\u201d) ARE MADE TO ASSIST OUR INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  ADJUSTED  EBITDA IS DEFINED AS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF LOAN COSTS, INTEREST INCOME, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION, AND NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE TRUST. WE PRESENT ADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE MEASUREMENTS  (A) MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ONGOING PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOTEL ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, (B) PROVIDE MORE USEFUL INFORMATION  TO INVESTORS AS INDICATORS OF OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR FUTURE DEBT PAYMENTS AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND (C) PROVIDE AN  OVERALL EVALUATION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADJUSTED EBITDA AS CALCULATED BY US MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED EBITDA REPORTED  BY OTHER COMPANIES THAT DO NOT DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA EXACTLY AS WE DEFINE THE TERM. ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED  FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO (A) GAAP NET INCOME  OR LOSS AS AN INDICATION OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR (B) GAAP CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY.  38  A RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE  TO CONTROLLING INTERESTS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018 IS APPROXIMATELY  AS FOLLOWS.

NAREIT DEVELOPED FFO AS A RELATIVE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE OF AN EQUITY REIT TO RECOGNIZE THAT INCOME-PRODUCING REAL  ESTATE HISTORICALLY HAS NOT DEPRECIATED ON THE BASIS DETERMINED BY GAAP. THE TRUST IS AN UNINCORPORATED OHIO REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT  TRUST; HOWEVER, THE TRUST IS NOT A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST FOR FEDERAL TAXATION PURPOSES. MANAGEMENT USES THIS MEASUREMENT  TO COMPARE ITSELF TO REITS WITH SIMILAR DEPRECIABLE ASSETS. WE CONSIDER FFO TO BE AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF OUR ONGOING NORMALIZED  OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE COMPUTE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY NAREIT, WHICH MAY NOT  BE COMPARABLE TO FFO REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES THAT EITHER DO NOT DEFINE THE TERM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION  OR INTERPRET THE NAREIT DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY THAN US. FFO DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS DETERMINED  BY GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO (A) GAAP NET INCOME OR LOSS AS AN INDICATION OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  OR (B) GAAP CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY, NOR IS IT INDICATIVE OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY  OUR CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. HOWEVER, TO FACILITATE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR HISTORICAL  OPERATING RESULTS, WE BELIEVE THAT FFO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH OUR NET INCOME OR LOSS AND CASH FLOWS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE ENGAGED THE SERVICES OF SEVERAL HOTEL  BROKERS AND BEGAN INDEPENDENTLY ADVERTISING OUR HOTELS FOR SALE. WE SOLD THE ONTARIO HOTEL IN JUNE 2017 AND THE YUMA HOTEL IN OCTOBER  2018.

WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MAJORITY-OWNED OR CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SEASONALITY  THE  HOTELS\\u2019 OPERATIONS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT SEASONAL. THE TUCSON ARIZONA HOTEL EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST OCCUPANCY IN  THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER (THE WINTER SEASON) AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER TENDS  TO BE THE LOWEST OCCUPANCY PERIOD AT THIS ARIZONA HOTEL. THIS SEASONALITY PATTERN CAN BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE  TRUST\\u2019S QUARTERLY REVENUES. THE HOTEL LOCATED IN NEW MEXICO HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCE THEIR MOST PROFITABLE PERIODS DURING  THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS (THE SUMMER SEASON), PROVIDING SOME BALANCE TO THE GENERAL SEASONALITY OF THE TRUST\\u2019S  HOTEL BUSINESS.  THE  SEASONAL NATURE OF THE TRUST\\u2019S BUSINESS INCREASES ITS VULNERABILITY TO RISKS SUCH AS LABOR FORCE SHORTAGES AND CASH FLOW  ISSUES.

THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING QUARTERLY UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019 (\\u201cANNUAL REPORT\\u201d). OUR ANNUAL REPORT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PRACTICES AND THE TRANSACTIONS THAT UNDERLIE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  WE PROVIDE A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF TRANSPORTATION, E-COMMERCE AND BUSINESS SERVICES THROUGH COMPANIES COMPETING COLLECTIVELY, OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY AND MANAGED COLLABORATIVELY, UNDER THE RESPECTED FEDEX BRAND. OUR PRIMARY OPERATING COMPANIES ARE FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION (\\u201cFEDEX EXPRESS\\u201d), INCLUDING TNT EXPRESS B.V. (\\u201cTNT EXPRESS\\u201d), THE WORLD\\u2019S LARGEST EXPRESS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY; FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE SYSTEM, INC. (\\u201cFEDEX GROUND\\u201d), A LEADING NORTH AMERICAN PROVIDER OF SMALL-PACKAGE GROUND DELIVERY SERVICES; AND FEDEX FREIGHT CORPORATION (\\u201cFEDEX FREIGHT\\u201d), A LEADING NORTH AMERICAN PROVIDER OF LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD (\\u201cLTL\\u201d) FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. THESE COMPANIES REPRESENT OUR MAJOR SERVICE LINES AND, ALONG WITH FEDEX CORPORATE SERVICES, INC. (\\u201cFEDEX SERVICES\\u201d), CONSTITUTE OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  OUR FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT PROVIDES SALES, MARKETING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATIONS, CUSTOMER SERVICE, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, BILLING AND COLLECTION SERVICES, AND CERTAIN BACK-OFFICE FUNCTIONS THAT SUPPORT OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. SEE \\u201cREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\\u201d FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR BUSINESSES CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.

PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  THE KEY INDICATORS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE.  \\u2022  THE OVERALL CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR VARIOUS SERVICES BASED ON MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY;  \\u2022  THE VOLUMES OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH OUR NETWORKS, PRIMARILY MEASURED BY OUR AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME AND SHIPMENT WEIGHT AND SIZE;  \\u2022  THE MIX OF SERVICES PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS;  \\u2022  THE PRICES WE OBTAIN FOR OUR SERVICES, PRIMARILY MEASURED BY YIELD (REVENUE PER PACKAGE OR POUND OR REVENUE PER SHIPMENT OR HUNDREDWEIGHT FOR LTL FREIGHT SHIPMENTS);  \\u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR COST STRUCTURE (CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES) TO MATCH SHIFTING VOLUME LEVELS; AND  \\u2022  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL PRICES AND OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER INCREMENTAL FUEL COSTS THROUGH OUR FUEL SURCHARGES.  MANY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY REVENUE AND VOLUME LEVELS, AND WE EXPECT THESE OPERATING EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS CONSISTENT WITH CHANGES IN REVENUES AND VOLUMES. THEREFORE, THE DISCUSSION OF OPERATING EXPENSE CAPTIONS FOCUSES ON THE KEY DRIVERS AND TRENDS IMPACTING EXPENSES OTHER THAN THOSE FACTORS STRICTLY RELATED TO CHANGES IN REVENUES AND VOLUMES. THE LINE ITEM \\u201cOTHER OPERATING EXPENSE\\u201d INCLUDES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTSIDE SERVICE CONTRACTS (SUCH AS FACILITY SERVICES AND CARGO HANDLING, TEMPORARY LABOR AND SECURITY), INSURANCE, PROFESSIONAL FEES, UNIFORMS AND ADVERTISING.

OUR FIRST QUARTER 2020 RESULTS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION DUE TO ONE FEWER OPERATING DAY. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS OF BUSINESS FROM A LARGE CUSTOMER AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, INCREASED YIELDS AT FEDEX FREIGHT AND FEDEX GROUND AND HIGHER VOLUME AT FEDEX GROUND. LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES BENEFITED THE COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS BY APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  WE INCURRED TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES TOTALING $71 MILLION ($55 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, A $50 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE INTEGRATION EXPENSES ARE PREDOMINANTLY INCREMENTAL COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION OF TNT EXPRESS, INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL AND LEGAL FEES, SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, TRAVEL AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES, AND INCLUDE ANY RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AT TNT EXPRESS. INTERNAL SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE INCLUDED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE ASSIGNED FULL-TIME TO INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES. THESE COSTS WERE INCURRED AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX CORPORATE. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE COSTS AS INTEGRATION-RELATED EXPENDITURES IS SUBJECT TO OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  - 30 -  THE FOLLOWING GRAPHS FOR FEDEX EXPRESS, FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT SHOW SELECTED VOLUME TRENDS (IN THOUSANDS) OVER THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.

(2)  INTERNATIONAL REVENUE PER POUND RELATES TO OUR INTERNATIONAL PRIORITY, ECONOMY AND AIRFREIGHT SERVICES.  - 32 -  REVENUE  REVENUES WERE FLAT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS HIGHER VOLUMES AND YIELDS AT FEDEX GROUND WERE OFFSET BY ONE FEWER OPERATING DAY AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF BUSINESS FROM A LARGE CUSTOMER AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND. AT FEDEX GROUND, REVENUES INCREASED 8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DUE TO VOLUME GROWTH AND INCREASED YIELDS. REVENUES AT FEDEX EXPRESS DECREASED 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATES AND LOWER FREIGHT POUNDS REFLECTING MACROECONOMIC WEAKNESS AND TRADE UNCERTAINTY. FEDEX FREIGHT REVENUES DECREASED 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DUE TO DECREASED AVERAGE DAILY SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE PER SHIPMENT.

IN ADDITION, ONE FEWER OPERATING DAY AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS, THE LOSS OF BUSINESS FROM A LARGE CUSTOMER AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND AND HIGHER PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS, INCLUDING HIGHER RATES AND INCREASED CAPACITY FOR SIX-DAY-PER-WEEK OPERATIONS YEAR-ROUND AT FEDEX GROUND, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, INCREASED YIELDS AT FEDEX FREIGHT AND FEDEX GROUND AND HIGHER VOLUME AT FEDEX GROUND.  THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 RESULTED IN A RECLASSIFICATION FROM OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE TO RENTALS AND LANDING FEES EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION AND MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS EXPENSE TO RENTALS AND LANDING FEES EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION. THESE AMOUNTS WERE RECLASSIFIED IN ORDER TO PROPERLY ALIGN THE LEASE AND RENTAL EXPENSES TO THE APPROPRIATE LINE ITEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW STANDARD AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING YEAR-OVER-YEAR EXPENSE CHANGE DISCUSSION.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE DECREASED 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER STAFFING TO SUPPORT VOLUME GROWTH AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE INCREASED 5% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS AT FEDEX GROUND AND HIGHER OUTSIDE SERVICE CONTRACTS AT FEDEX EXPRESS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED 9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAMS AT ALL TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS INCREASED 2% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RATES AND EXPANSION OF THE FEDEX GROUND NETWORK TO SIX-DAY-PER-WEEK OPERATIONS YEAR-ROUND IN JANUARY 2019, AS WELL AS HIGHER VOLUMES AT FEDEX GROUND. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS EXPENSE INCREASED 4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AIRCRAFT ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AT FEDEX EXPRESS.  - 33 -  FUEL  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS SHOWS OUR AVERAGE COST OF JET AND VEHICLE FUEL PER GALLON FOR THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.  FUEL EXPENSE DECREASED 12% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED FUEL PRICES. HOWEVER, FUEL PRICES REPRESENT ONLY ONE COMPONENT OF THE FACTORS WE CONSIDER MEANINGFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR BUSINESS. CONSIDERATION MUST ALSO BE GIVEN TO THE FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE WE COLLECT. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE DISCUSSION OF THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR RESULTS, WHICH IS A COMPARISON OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN THESE TWO FACTORS, IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF FUEL SURCHARGES ON THE TREND IN REVENUE AND YIELD GROWTH, WE HAVE INCLUDED THE COMPARATIVE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE FUEL SURCHARGE PERCENTAGES IN EFFECT FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF 2020 AND 2019 IN THE ACCOMPANYING DISCUSSION OF EACH OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS.  MOST OF OUR FUEL SURCHARGES ARE ADJUSTED ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE FUEL SURCHARGE IS BASED ON A WEEKLY FUEL PRICE FROM TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE WEEK IN WHICH IT IS ASSESSED. SOME FEDEX EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL FUEL SURCHARGES INCORPORATE A TIMING LAG OF APPROXIMATELY SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS.  THE MANNER IN WHICH WE PURCHASE FUEL ALSO INFLUENCES THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR CONTRACTS FOR JET FUEL PURCHASES AT FEDEX EXPRESS ARE TIED TO VARIOUS INDICES, INCLUDING THE U.S. GULF COAST INDEX. WHILE MANY OF THESE INDICES ARE ALIGNED, EACH INDEX MAY FLUCTUATE AT A DIFFERENT PACE, DRIVING VARIABILITY IN THE PRICES PAID FOR JET FUEL. FURTHERMORE, UNDER THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 70% OF OUR JET FUEL IS PURCHASED BASED ON THE INDEX PRICE FOR THE PRECEDING WEEK, WITH THE REMAINDER OF OUR PURCHASES TIED TO THE INDEX PRICE FOR THE PRECEDING MONTH AND PRECEDING DAY, RATHER THAN BASED ON DAILY SPOT RATES. THESE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF RAPIDLY CHANGING DAILY SPOT RATES ON OUR JET FUEL PURCHASES.  BECAUSE OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED SHOULD THE MARKET PRICE OF FUEL SUDDENLY CHANGE BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OR CHANGE BY AMOUNTS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN AN ADJUSTMENT IN OUR FUEL SURCHARGES, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IN THE SHORT-TERM.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL HAD A SLIGHT BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS DECREASED FUEL PRICES MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER FUEL SURCHARGES.  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW OUR FUEL SURCHARGES. ON MARCH 18, 2019, WE UPDATED THE TABLES USED TO DETERMINE OUR FUEL SURCHARGES FOR FEDEX EXPRESS U.S. DOMESTIC SERVICES AND AT FEDEX GROUND. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2018, WE UPDATED THE TABLES USED TO DETERMINE OUR FUEL SURCHARGES AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND. THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OPERATING INCOME DESCRIBED ABOVE AND FOR EACH SEGMENT BELOW EXCLUDES THE IMPACT FROM THESE TABLE CHANGES.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS DOES NOT CONSIDER THE EFFECTS THAT FUEL SURCHARGE LEVELS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN DEMAND AND SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF SERVICES PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE MAY BE IMPACTED BY FUEL COSTS. WHILE FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL SURCHARGE PERCENTAGES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, FUEL SURCHARGES REPRESENT ONE OF THE MANY INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF OUR PRICING STRUCTURE THAT IMPACT OUR OVERALL REVENUE AND YIELD. ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS INCLUDE THE MIX OF SERVICES SOLD, THE BASE PRICE AND EXTRA SERVICE CHARGES WE OBTAIN FOR THESE SERVICES AND THE LEVEL OF PRICING DISCOUNTS OFFERED.  - 34 -  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 25.2% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, COMPARED WITH 24.2% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE 2020 TAX RATE WAS IMPACTED BY DECREASED EARNINGS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS U.S. STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) FOR THE 2016 AND 2017 TAX YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER APPEALS PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE IRS\\u2019S PROPOSED AUDIT ADJUSTMENT FOR THE 2014 AND 2015 TAX YEARS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN INCOME TAX RETURN PROCEEDINGS WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN OUR BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2019.  OUTLOOK  WE EXPECT OPERATING INCOME DECLINES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020 RESULTING FROM LOWER REVENUE AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AT FEDEX GROUND.  OUR OUTLOOK ON GLOBAL TRADE HAS WEAKENED SINCE THE PREVIOUS QUARTER DUE TO ESCALATING TRADE TENSIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS, INCREASING SOFTNESS IN EUROPEAN MARKETS AND DECLINES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN GLOBAL TRADE THAN OUR U.S. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SHIPMENTS INTERNATIONALLY. THE SOFTER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IS EXPECTED TO CREATE AN ONGOING REVENUE SHORTFALL FROM PLANNED LEVELS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC. THE COST OF MAINTAINING TWO SEPARATE NETWORKS IN EUROPE WHILE WE EXECUTE THE TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION IS EXPECTED TO COMPOUND THE IMPACT OF THE REVENUE SHORTFALL ON OUR NEAR-TERM RESULTS.  IN THE U.S. DOMESTIC PACKAGE MARKET, INCREMENTAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MODERNIZING OUR FEDEX EXPRESS NETWORK AND PERMANENTLY EXPANDING OUR FEDEX GROUND NETWORK OPERATIONS TO SEVEN DAYS PER WEEK YEAR-ROUND, COMBINED WITH SHORT-TERM VOLUME DECLINES FROM THE LOSS OF A LARGE CUSTOMER, HAS CREATED A NEAR-TERM COST-TO-VOLUME DISPARITY. HOWEVER, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR U.S. DOMESTIC PACKAGE OPERATIONS WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN HIGHER REVENUE THAT MORE THAN OFFSETS THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS.  IN RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE ARE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR GLOBAL FEDEX EXPRESS AIR NETWORK TO BETTER MATCH CAPACITY WITH DEMAND. THESE CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS WILL RESULT IN ACCELERATING PLANNED AIRCRAFT RETIREMENTS OVER THE CURRENT AND NEXT FISCAL YEARS, AND WE ARE PARKING ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT AFTER THE 2020 PEAK SEASON. THESE ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND/OR IMMATERIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON COST REDUCTIONS BY LIMITING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND DEFERRING NON-CRITICAL HIRING.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020, WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION PLANS AND ARE FOCUSED ON COMPLETING PROJECTS ACROSS OUR EUROPEAN HUB AND STATION LOCATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN THE GROUND NETWORKS FOR BOTH FEDEX EXPRESS AND TNT EXPRESS PACKAGES, WHICH WILL FURTHER LOWER COSTS AS THE RELATED FEDEX EXPRESS LINEHAUL OPERATIONS ARE OPTIMIZED. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE OPERATIONAL NETWORK INTEGRATION PROCESS FOR THE KEY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, WHICH REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF INTERNATIONAL REVENUE, WORKFORCES AND FACILITIES. INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE ARE COMPLEX AND REQUIRE CONSULTATIONS WITH WORKS COUNCILS AND EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN 2020, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, INTEGRATION WORK WILL CONTINUE THEREAFTER. AFTER 2020, THE NEXT KEY INTEGRATION MILESTONES INCLUDE COMPLETING A SINGLE PORTFOLIO OF SERVICES AND AIR NETWORK INTEGRATION. WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION OF INTEGRATION EXPENSES IN THE REMAINDER OF 2020 IN THE FORM OF PROFESSIONAL FEES, OUTSIDE SERVICE CONTRACTS, SALARIES AND WAGES AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE. WE EXPECT THE AGGREGATE INTEGRATION PROGRAM EXPENSES, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AT TNT EXPRESS, TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION THROUGH 2021, AND WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS THAT WILL FURTHER TRANSFORM AND OPTIMIZE THE COMBINED BUSINESSES. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEGRATION EXPENSES AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD MAY CHANGE AS WE REVISE AND IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS.  OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020 ARE DEPENDENT ON KEY EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING MODERATE U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH, CURRENT FUEL PRICE EXPECTATIONS, NO FURTHER WEAKENING IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FROM OUR CURRENT FORECAST AND NO ADDITIONAL ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICIES AND RELATIONS.  OTHER OUTLOOK MATTERS.  FOR DETAILS ON KEY 2020 CAPITAL PROJECTS, REFER TO THE \\u201cLIQUIDITY OUTLOOK\\u201d SECTION OF THIS MD&A.  SEE \\u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\u201d AND PART II, ITEM 1A \\u201cRISK FACTORS\\u201d FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  - 35 -  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  SEE NOTE 1  OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR  A DISCUSSION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

WE REVIEW AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS BASED ON OPERATING INCOME (INCLUSIVE OF FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT ALLOCATIONS). FOR THE FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT, PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED BASED ON THE IMPACT OF ITS TOTAL ALLOCATED NET OPERATING COSTS ON OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE ALLOCATIONS APPROXIMATE THE NET COST OF PROVIDING THESE FUNCTIONS. OUR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES ARE REFINED PERIODICALLY, AS NECESSARY, TO REFLECT CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESSES.  CORPORATE, OTHER AND ELIMINATIONS  CORPORATE AND OTHER INCLUDES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS COSTS FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CERTAIN LEGAL AND FINANCE FUNCTIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COSTS AND CREDITS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO OUR CORE BUSINESS. THESE COSTS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  ALSO INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER IS THE FEDEX OFFICE OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH PROVIDES AN ARRAY OF DOCUMENT AND BUSINESS SERVICES AND RETAIL ACCESS TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PACKAGE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES, AND THE FEDEX LOGISTICS, INC. OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH PROVIDES INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, SPECIALTY TRANSPORTATION, CROSS-BORDER E-COMMERCE TECHNOLOGY AND E-COMMERCE TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS, CUSTOMS BROKERAGE AND GLOBAL OCEAN AND AIR FREIGHT FORWARDING.  CERTAIN FEDEX OPERATING COMPANIES PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED SERVICES FOR OTHER FEDEX COMPANIES OUTSIDE THEIR REPORTABLE SEGMENT. BILLINGS FOR SUCH SERVICES ARE BASED ON NEGOTIATED RATES, WHICH WE BELIEVE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, AND ARE REFLECTED AS REVENUES OF THE BILLING SEGMENT. THESE RATES ARE ADJUSTED FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. SUCH INTERSEGMENT REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE ELIMINATED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND ARE NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT INFORMATION BECAUSE THE AMOUNTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.  - 36 -  FEDEX EXPRESS SEGMENT  FEDEX EXPRESS OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF U.S. DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING SERVICES FOR DELIVERY OF PACKAGES AND FREIGHT INCLUDING PRIORITY, DEFERRED AND ECONOMY SERVICES, WHICH PROVIDE DELIVERY ON A TIME-DEFINITE OR DAY-DEFINITE BASIS.

THE TIMING AND VOLUME OF REPURCHASES ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT, BASED ON THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS, THE MARKET PRICE OF FEDEX COMMON STOCK AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. NO TIME LIMIT WAS SET FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM, AND THE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  - 44 -  CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE, CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN AIRCRAFT, VEHICLES AND TRAILERS, TECHNOLOGY, FACILITIES, AND PACKAGE HANDLING AND SORT EQUIPMENT. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEPEND ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING PRE-EXISTING CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, ANTICIPATED VOLUME GROWTH, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, NEW OR ENHANCED SERVICES, GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION OF SERVICES, AVAILABILITY OF SATISFACTORY FINANCING AND ACTIONS OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE COMPARES CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY ASSET CATEGORY AND REPORTABLE SEGMENT FOR THE PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31 (IN MILLIONS).

THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING ACROSS ALL ASSET CATEGORIES AT FEDEX GROUND.  LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, DEBT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AND TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT AUGUST 31, 2019 INCLUDES $1.3 BILLION OF CASH IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PERMANENT REINVESTMENT STRATEGY. WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE MAJORITY OF THIS CASH WITHOUT A MATERIAL TAX COST, AS THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\\u201cTCJA\\u201d) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE COST OF REPATRIATING FOREIGN EARNINGS FROM A U.S. TAX PERSPECTIVE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF THESE FUNDS IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR U.S. DOMESTIC DEBT OR WORKING CAPITAL OBLIGATIONS.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $5.9 BILLION IN 2020, AND INCLUDE SPENDING FOR AIRCRAFT AND HUB MODERNIZATION AT FEDEX EXPRESS, INVESTMENTS THAT INCREASE OUR EFFICIENCY IN HANDLING LARGE PACKAGES AT FEDEX GROUND AND INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY ACROSS ALL TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS THAT WILL FURTHER OPTIMIZE OUR NETWORKS AND ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITIES. WE INVESTED $0.5 BILLION IN AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND EXPECT TO INVEST AN ADDITIONAL $1.0 BILLION FOR AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2020. IN ADDITION, WE ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS IN OUR FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE FEDEX EXPRESS INDIANAPOLIS HUB AND APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO MODERNIZE THE FEDEX EXPRESS MEMPHIS WORLD HUB. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2020. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING UNSECURED FINANCING, FROM BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SOURCES, ALTHOUGH THE MARKETPLACE FOR SUCH INVESTMENT CAPITAL CAN BECOME RESTRICTED DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC FACTORS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, FEDEX EXPRESS EXERCISED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL SIX B767F AIRCRAFT FOR DELIVERY IN 2022.  WE HAVE A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\\u201cSEC\\u201d) THAT ALLOWS US TO SELL, IN ONE OR MORE FUTURE OFFERINGS, ANY COMBINATION OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT SECURITIES AND COMMON STOCK.  - 45 -  WE HAVE A  $2.0 BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cFIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d) AND A $1.5 BILLION 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201c364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d AND, TOGETHER WITH THE FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE \\u201cCREDIT AGREEMENTS\\u201d). THE FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2024 AND INCLUDES A $250 MILLION LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT. THE 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2020.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND OTHER CASH FLOW NEEDS.  SEE NOTE 3 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE TERMS AND SIGNIFICANT COVENANTS OF  THE  CREDIT AGREEMENTS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE MADE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $1.0 BILLION TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020. OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS HAVE AMPLE FUNDS TO MEET EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

IF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS DROP BELOW CURRENT LEVELS, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY UTILIZING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. IF OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATINGS DROP BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING MAY BECOME LIMITED.  CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A SUMMARY OF OUR CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019. CERTAIN OF THESE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE REFLECTED IN OUR BALANCE SHEET, WHILE OTHERS ARE DISCLOSED AS FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES.

SEE NOTE 8 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON SUCH PURCHASE ORDERS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR OPERATING LEASES REPRESENT UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES (PRINCIPALLY FACILITIES AND AIRCRAFT) WITH AN INITIAL OR REMAINING TERM IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AT AUGUST 31, 2019. UNDER THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING RULES, THE MAJORITY OF THESE LEASES ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AT THE NET PRESENT VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS A LIABILITY WITH AN OFFSETTING RIGHT-TO-USE ASSET.  - 46 -  INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE WITHIN THE CAPTION ENTITLED \\u201cNON-CAPITAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER\\u201d IS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT PORTION OF THE  LIABILITY ($125  MILLION) FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF THE LONG-TERM PAYMENTS OR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE LIABILITY WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OVER TIME; THEREFORE, THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THE LIABILITY ($36  MILLION) IS EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE.  THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR INTEREST ON LONG-TERM DEBT REPRESENT FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS DUE ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR CAPITAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT NONCANCELABLE AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE CAPITAL-RELATED EQUIPMENT. SUCH CONTRACTS INCLUDE THOSE FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES OF AIRCRAFT, AIRCRAFT MODIFICATIONS, VEHICLES AND TRAILERS, FACILITIES, COMPUTERS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT.  WE HAD $611 MILLION IN DEPOSITS AND PROGRESS PAYMENTS AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019 ON AIRCRAFT PURCHASES AND OTHER PLANNED AIRCRAFT-RELATED TRANSACTIONS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR LONG-TERM DEBT REPRESENT FUTURE SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON AMOUNTS INCLUDED WITHIN THE OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES CAPTIONS IN THE TABLE ABOVE CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.  OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, FEDEX FILED SUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SEEKING TO ENJOIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FROM ENFORCING PROHIBITIONS CONTAINED IN THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS (THE \\u201cEARS\\u201d) AGAINST FEDEX. FEDEX BELIEVES THAT THE EARS VIOLATE COMMON CARRIERS\\u2019 RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AS THEY UNREASONABLY HOLD COMMON CARRIERS STRICTLY LIABLE FOR SHIPMENTS THAT MAY VIOLATE THE EARS WITHOUT REQUIRING EVIDENCE THAT THE CARRIERS HAD KNOWLEDGE OF ANY VIOLATIONS.  THE CHINA STATE POST BUREAU IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE OPERATIONS OF FEDEX EXPRESS REGARDING ITS HANDLING OF CERTAIN PACKAGES WHILE ATTEMPTING TO COMPLY WITH THE EARS. FEDEX EXPRESS HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES ON THE INVESTIGATION.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES TO DEVELOP AMOUNTS REFLECTED AND DISCLOSED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MANY CASES, THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE POLICIES OR ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES THAT COULD BE USED. WE MAINTAIN A THOROUGH PROCESS TO REVIEW THE APPLICATION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND TO EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE MANY ESTIMATES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PREPARE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A COMPLEX, GLOBAL CORPORATION. HOWEVER, EVEN UNDER OPTIMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, ESTIMATES ROUTINELY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT BASED ON CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEW OR BETTER INFORMATION.  GOODWILL.  GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT HAS FALLEN BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN ANY OTHER CHANGE OF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT A REEVALUATION OF THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS REQUIRED AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, NOR DO WE BELIEVE THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS AT RISK OF FAILING IMPAIRMENT TESTING. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.  INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING NOTE 1 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THEREIN. MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WITH OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  - 47 -  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  CERTAIN STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) THOSE CONTAINED IN \\u201cFUEL,\\u201d \\u201cINCOME TAXES,\\u201d \\u201cOUTLOOK,\\u201d \\u201cINDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDER MODELS,\\u201d \\u201cLIQUIDITY OUTLOOK,\\u201d \\u201cCONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\\u201d AND \\u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES,\\u201d AND THE \\u201cFINANCING ARRANGEMENTS,\\u201d \\u201cLEASES,\\u201d \\u201cCOMMITMENTS\\u201d AND \\u201cCONTINGENCIES\\u201d NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ARE \\u201cFORWARD-LOOKING\\u201d STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 WITH RESPECT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, PLANS, OBJECTIVES, FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND BUSINESS.

THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID BY BUYER WAS $375,000, AND SELLER ASSUMED ALL OF THE LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE CLOSING DATE.  ON THE CLOSING OF THE ABOVE TRANSACTION, MR. CHEE CHAU NG, THE SOLE OFFICER OF SELLER, RESIGNED IN ALL OFFICER CAPACITIES FROM THE COMPANY AND ANTHONY LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, MR. LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. EFFECTIVE UPON THE 10TH DAY AFTER THE MAILING OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S INFORMATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14F-1 (THE \\u201cSCHEDULE 14F-1\\u201d) TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS (THE \\u201cAPPOINTMENT DATE\\u201d), MR. NG RESIGNED AS A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. ON THAT SAME DATE, MR. LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED AS THE COMPANY\\u2019S CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY IS A SHELL COMPANY AS DEFINED IN RULE 12B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \\u201cEXCHANGE ACT\\u201d). OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OBJECTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL THROUGH A COMBINATION WITH A BUSINESS RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE, SHORT-TERM EARNINGS. THE COMPANY WILL NOT RESTRICT OUR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE TARGET COMPANIES TO ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESS, INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND, THUS, MAY ACQUIRE ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS.  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW. DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO.  (I)  FILING EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS, AND  (II)  INVESTIGATING, ANALYZING AND CONSUMMATING AN ACQUISITION.  WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH DEFERRAL OF FEES BY CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AS NECESSARY, TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGEMENT OR OTHER INVESTORS. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS $0 IN CASH. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS NEEDED. CURRENTLY, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE FUTURE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCING TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPAY OUR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEN THEY COME DUE. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND A SUITABLE TARGET COMPANY AND ENTER INTO A POSSIBLE REVERSE MERGER WITH SUCH COMPANY. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S PLAN INCLUDES OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY EQUITY FINANCING THROUGH A REVERSE MERGER TRANSACTION AND/OR RELATED PARTY ADVANCES; HOWEVER THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEING AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER ACQUIRING A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT NEED SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR ITS SHARES WHILE AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF VOTING CONTROL WHICH MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY PARTY REGARDING A BUSINESS COMBINATION. ANY TARGET BUSINESS THAT IS SELECTED MAY BE A FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE COMPANY OR AN ENTITY IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OR GROWTH, INCLUDING ENTITIES WITHOUT ESTABLISHED RECORDS OF SALES OR EARNINGS. IN THAT EVENT, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS INHERENT IN THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE AND EARLY STAGE OR POTENTIAL EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN ENTITY IN AN INDUSTRY CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK, AND, ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT WILL ENDEAVOR TO EVALUATE THE RISKS INHERENT IN A PARTICULAR TARGET BUSINESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PROPERLY ASCERTAIN OR ASSESS ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS. OUR MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO EFFECT ONLY ONE BUSINESS COMBINATION, DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR LIMITED FINANCING AND THE DILUTION OF INTEREST FOR PRESENT AND PROSPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF OUR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S PLAN TO OFFER A CONTROLLING INTEREST TO A TARGET BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION. THIS LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTANTIAL RISK IN INVESTING IN US, BECAUSE IT WILL NOT PERMIT US TO OFFSET POTENTIAL LOSSES FROM ONE VENTURE AGAINST GAINS FROM ANOTHER.  WE WILL NOT ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH ANY ENTITY WHICH CANNOT PROVIDE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT OR WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AFTER CLOSING OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT. INCLUDED IN THESE REQUIREMENTS IS OUR DUTY TO FILE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS PART OF OUR FORM 8-K TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UPON CONSUMMATION OF A MERGER OR ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS OUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IF SUCH AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT CLOSING, OR WITHIN TIME PARAMETERS NECESSARY TO INSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR IF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDED DO NOT CONFORM TO THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE TARGET BUSINESS, THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS MAY PROVIDE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WILL BE VOIDABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT.  A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH A TARGET BUSINESS WILL NORMALLY INVOLVE THE TRANSFER TO THE TARGET BUSINESS OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THE SUBSTITUTION BY THE TARGET BUSINESS OF ITS OWN MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  12  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE SELECTION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION WILL BE COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY RISKY. BECAUSE OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BEING MADE IN SOME INDUSTRIES AND SHORTAGES OF AVAILABLE CAPITAL, OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRMS SEEKING THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION. SUCH PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATING OR IMPROVING THE TERMS ON WHICH ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING MAY BE OBTAINED, PROVIDING LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRINCIPALS OF AND INVESTORS IN A BUSINESS, CREATING A MEANS FOR PROVIDING INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS OR SIMILAR BENEFITS TO KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OFFERING GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN STRUCTURING ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND THE LIKE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK. POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS MAY OCCUR IN MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND AT VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, ALL OF WHICH WILL MAKE THE TASK OF COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF SUCH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL, LOCATE AND COMPLETE A MERGER WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NO REVENUE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018. IT IS UNLIKELY THE COMPANY WILL HAVE ANY REVENUES UNLESS IT IS ABLE TO EFFECT AN ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH AN OPERATING COMPANY, OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE. IT IS MANAGEMENT\\u2019 S ASSERTION THAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HINDER THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE COMPANY\\u2019S PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS SHALL BE TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $31,086, COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES INCURRED IN RELATION TO THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, FORM 10-Q AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019  WAS  $3.7 MILLION  , COMPARED TO AN OPERATING LOSS OF  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR QUARTER. DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER, SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS WAS PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES.  OVERHEAD  UNALLOCATED OVERHEAD EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019  INCREASED  BY  $7.7 MILLION  TO  $28.6 MILLION  , FROM  $20.9 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR QUARTER. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN EXPENSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S NEW TECHNOLOGY AND DATA ANALYTICS PLATFORMS, HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RECENT SYSTEM UPGRADES WHICH ARE NOW IN SERVICE, A  $1.5 MILLION  SETTLEMENT IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR QUARTER, WITHOUT ADMISSION OF LIABILITY, OF A CLAIM FOR ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND HIGHER SEVERANCE EXPENSE.  SEASONALITY  THE COMPANY\\u2019S  CHILDREN\\u2019S BOOK PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION  SCHOOL-BASED BOOK CLUB AND BOOK FAIR CHANNELS AND MOST OF ITS  EDUCATION  BUSINESSES OPERATE ON A SCHOOL-YEAR BASIS; THEREFORE, THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SEASONAL. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY\\u2019S REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR GENERALLY ARE LOWER THAN ITS REVENUES IN THE OTHER TWO FISCAL QUARTERS. TYPICALLY, SCHOOL-BASED CHANNELS AND MAGAZINE REVENUES ARE MINIMAL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR AS SCHOOLS ARE NOT IN SESSION. TRADE SALES CAN VARY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR DUE TO VARYING RELEASE DATES OF PUBLISHED TITLES. THE COMPANY GENERALLY EXPERIENCES A LOSS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. AS THE COMPANY'S  EDUCATION  SEGMENT BEGINS TO SELL ITS CORE CURRICULUM OFFERING, SCHOLASTIC LITERACY, THESE REVENUES ARE LIKELY TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, WHEN SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS ARE PREPARING FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR.  27  SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\\u201cMD&A\\u201d)  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $97.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $89.0 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING  AN INCREASE  IN CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $8.6 MILLION  . THE  INCREASE  IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE BALANCES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED TRADE CHANNEL REVENUES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $24.3 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $37.4 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING  A DECREASE  IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $13.1 MILLION  . THE DECREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING ON THE NOW COMPLETED COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS BUILDING MODERNIZATION PROJECT.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $12.3 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $5.2 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $17.5 MILLION  . THE INCREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY, WHICH WERE  $12.6 MILLION  IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR PERIOD WITH NO SUCH REPURCHASES IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR QUARTER AND LAST FISCAL YEAR'S PROCEEDS PURSUANT TO STOCK OPTION EXERCISES OF  $2.7 MILLION  WITH NO PROCEEDS RECEIVED IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER.  CASH POSITION  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED  $199.4 MILLION  AT  AUGUST 31, 2019  ,  $334.1 MILLION  AT MAY 31, 2019 AND  $269.8 MILLION  AT  AUGUST 31, 2018  .

DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS AS DISCUSSED UNDER \\u201cSEASONALITY\\u201d ABOVE, THE COMPANY USUALLY EXPERIENCES NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS IN THE JUNE THROUGH OCTOBER TIME PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESS CYCLE, BORROWINGS HAVE HISTORICALLY INCREASED DURING JUNE, JULY AND AUGUST, HAVE GENERALLY PEAKED IN SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER, AND HAVE BEEN AT THEIR LOWEST POINT IN MAY.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING PHILOSOPHY IS TO USE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO CREATE VALUE BY PAYING DOWN DEBT, REINVESTING IN EXISTING BUSINESSES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKING ACQUISITIONS THAT WILL COMPLEMENT ITS PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES OR ACQUIRING OTHER STRATEGIC ASSETS, AS WELL AS ENGAGING IN SHAREHOLDER ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVES, SUCH AS SHARE REPURCHASES OR DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO USE ITS CASH POSITION, COMBINED WITH IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN DATA, TO REDUCE PROCUREMENT COSTS ACROSS THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES.  THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED, AND EXPECTS TO MAINTAIN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, DIVIDENDS, CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES, DEBT SERVICE, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. AS OF  AUGUST 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY\\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY CONSISTED OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $199.4 MILLION  , CASH FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDING AVAILABLE UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $375.0 MILLION  . THE COMPANY MAY AT ANY TIME, BUT IN ANY EVENT NOT MORE THAN ONCE IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR, REQUEST THAT THE AGGREGATE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT BE INCREASED BY AN AMOUNT OF $10.0 MILLION OR AN INTEGRAL MULTIPLE OF $10.0 MILLION (BUT NOT TO EXCEED $150.0 MILLION). ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $49.3 MILLION, LESS CURRENT BORROWINGS OF  $13.0 MILLION  AND COMMITMENTS OF  $4.9 MILLION  , RESULTING IN $31.4 MILLION OF CURRENT AVAILABILITY AT  AUGUST 31, 2019  . ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE ITS ONGOING OPERATING NEEDS, AS WELL AS ITS FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  28  SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION  ITEM 2.

THE LEGAL EXPENSES PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM A SETTLEMENT OF A GENERAL LIABILITY CASE IN DENVER, COLORADO AND A TRADEMARK DISPUTE IN ARKANSAS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION -  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED FROM $316,000 DURING THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 13, 2018 TO $384,000 DURING THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 12, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADDITIONAL RESTAURANTS ACQUIRED.  INTEREST EXPENSE -  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED FROM $267,000 DURING THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 13, 2018 TO $249,000 DURING THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 13, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER DEBT BALANCE PRIMARILY RELATING TO LOANS FOR THE PURCHASE AND REMODEL OF THE 4B\\u2019S RESTAURANT IN MISSOULA, MONTANA IN THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 12, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 13, 2018.  OTHER INCOME -  OTHER INCOME CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF RENTAL INCOME FROM THE COMPANY\\u2019S LEASED PROPERTIES. RENTAL INCOME WAS $49,000 FOR TWO PROPERTIES LEASED FOR THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 13, 2018. RENTAL INCOME WAS $39,000 FOR ONE PROPERTY LEASED FOR THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 12, 2019. RENTAL INCOME WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF ONE TENANT.  INCOME TAXES -  THE INCOME TAX PROVISION TOTALED $20,000 FOR THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 13, 2018 AND $15,000 FOR THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 12, 2019. THE COMPANY HAS NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS OF $0 ON AUGUST 13, 2018 AND JANUARY 29, 2018. THE COMPANY HAS A NET OPERATING LOSS FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. THE COMPANY HAS FULL VALUATION AGAINST ITS EXISTING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS OF AUGUST 12, 2019.  16  IMPACT OF INFLATION  THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON FOOD, LABOR, EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION AND REMODELING OF RESTAURANTS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY\\u2019S MARGINS. MANY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S EMPLOYEES ARE PAID HOURLY RATES RELATED TO STATE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS  THAT ARE TIED TO INFLATION INDEXES SO THAT CHANGES IN THESE LAWS WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER LABOR COSTS TO THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, FOOD ITEMS PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND PRESSURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MODEST INCREASES IN THESE COSTS CAN BE OFFSET THROUGH PRICE CHANGES AND OTHER COST CONTROL EFFORTS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE ABLE TO PASS SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS FINANCED OPERATIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH ON HAND, CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS AND LOANS FROM OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS.  AS OF AUGUST 12, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $121,000 IN CASH.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $42,000 DURING THE 28-WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 12, 2019. THE NET WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT WAS $5.2 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION AT AUGUST 12, 2019 AND JANUARY 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND ANTICIPATE RAISING SUCH CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OR DEBT. WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN BORROWING REQUIRED CAPITAL TO GROW OUR BUSINESS FROM OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS. WE HAVE NO COMMITMENT FROM THEM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL VOLUNTARILY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AS NEEDED. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AS NEEDED, AND WE WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY GENERATES CASH FLOW DAILY FROM SALES IN ITS RESTAURANTS AND MANAGES ITS CASH BALANCES TO MEET ITS CURRENT OPERATING OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $175,000 ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE 28-WEEKS ENDING AUGUST 12, 2019, PRIMARILY ON EXISTING RESTAURANTS.  CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY $187,000 FOR THE 28-WEEKS ENDING AUGUST 12, 2019 AND $533,000 FOR THE 28-WEEKS ENDING AUGUST 13, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDING AUGUST 12, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NET LOSS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $54,000 FOR THE 28-WEEKS ENDING AUGUST 12, 2019 COMPARED TO CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $326,000 FOR THE 28-WEEKS ENDING AUGUST 13, 2018. IN THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020, CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY MADE NET DEBT PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $125,000 AND HAD CHECKS WRITTEN IN EXCESS OF BANK BALANCE OF $71,000, A CHANGE OF $71,000. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY MADE NET DEBT PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $196,000 AND HAD CHECKS WRITTEN IN EXCESS OF BANK BALANCE OF $108,000, A CHANGE OF $130,000.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  AUGUST 12, 2019  AUGUST 12, 2019  JANUARY 28, 2019  JANUARY 28, 2019  TYPE OF DEBT  (1)  TOTAL DEBT  CURRENT PORTION  TOTAL DEBT  CURRENT PORTION  REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES  $2,370,000  $332,000  $2,485,000  $560,000  OTHER-MISCELLANEOUS  246,000  16,000  253,000  10,000  NOTE PAYABLE TO OFFICER  1,992,000  -  1,992,000  -  TOTAL DEBT  $4,608,000  $348,000  $4,730,000  $570,000  (1)  THE INTEREST RATES RANGE FROM 6% TO 11.5%. THE MATURITY DATES OF THE OBLIGATIONS RANGE FROM NOVEMBER 2019 TO OCTOBER 2035.  DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY BORROWED APPROXIMATELY $1,400,000 FROM MR.  WHEATON.  IN JUNE 2008, THE COMPANY BORROWED AN ADDITIONAL $592,000 FROM MR. WHEATON UNDER THE SAME TERMS. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE NOTE BALANCE FROM $1,400,000 TO $1,992,000, THE BALANCE AS OF AUGUST 12, 2019 AND JANUARY 28, 2019. THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST WERE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL ON JUNE 5, 2012. THE LOAN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BANKRUPTCY FILING AND PURSUANT TO THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON DECEMBER 17, 2012 (THE \\u201cBANKRUPTCY PLAN\\u201d), THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE REPAID UNTIL ALL OBLIGATIONS OWED TO OTHER CREDITORS HAVE BEEN FULLY SATISFIED. INTEREST ACCRUED ON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1,992,000 AND THE INTEREST OF $197,000 FROM SEPTEMBER 28, 2011 TO DECEMBER 7, 2016 AT THE BANKRUPTCY PLAN RATE. WHEN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED INTO A FINAL DECREE AND ORDER CLOSING THE BANKRUPTCY CASE OF STAR BUFFET, INC. ON DECEMBER 7, 2016 THE COMPANY REVERTED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTEREST RATE OF 8.5%. THE COMPANY EXPENSED $105,000 TO ROBERT E. WHEATON FOR INTEREST DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019.  17  ON NOVEMBER 9, 2016, THE COMPANY BORROWED $450,000 FROM MR. ROBERT E. WHEATON TO REMODEL THE 4B\\u2019 RESTAURANT IN MISSOULA, MONTANA. THE THREE-YEAR FULLY AMORTIZED SECURED LOAN HAS MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF $14,839 AND INTEREST RATE OF 11.5%. THE COMPANY PAID MR. WHEATON APPROXIMATELY $82,000 AND $81,000 IN PRINCIPAL DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THIS MORTGAGE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY $7,000 AND $14,000 IN INTEREST DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS  THE COMPANY PREPARES ITS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH US GAAP. THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1\\u2014SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED IN THE 2019 FORM 10-K. CERTAIN OF THESE POLICIES REQUIRE NUMEROUS ESTIMATES AND STRATEGIC OR ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE INACCURATE OR BE SUBJECT TO VARIATIONS AND WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION FOR THE REPORTED PERIOD OR IN FUTURE PERIODS. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING FACTORS, ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES IN ANY OF THESE AREAS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - BASIC IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \\u2013 DILUTED IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED CALCULATION USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD.  BASIC EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIODS. DILUTED EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED CALCULATION USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS FOR THE FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING AUGUST 12, 2019 AND AUGUST 13, 2018.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  THE COMPANY EVALUATES IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360, \\u201cPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\u201d.  THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN IS NECESSARY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET.  IF SUCH ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. ANY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO EARNINGS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN THE AFFECTED PERIOD.  JUDGMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO REALIZE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF SUCH ASSETS ARE AFFECTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS OF THE ASSETS, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND CHANGES IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE. AS THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ONGOING EXPECTED NET CASH FLOWS AND CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REALIZE A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD.  18  BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT  BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE PROVIDED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE FOLLOWING USEFUL LIVES.  YEARS  BUILDING  40  LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS  15  -  20  (1)  FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT  5  -  8  (1)  LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE LESSER OF THE LIFE OF THE LEASE OR THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSETS. THE LIFE OF THE LEASE INCLUDES RENEWAL OPTIONS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT AT LEASE INCEPTION AS REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE EXERCISED. IF A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED LEASE OPTION IS NOT EXERCISED, ANY REMAINING UNAMORTIZED LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO OPERATING RESULTS IN THAT PERIOD.  EQUIPMENT IN NON-OPERATING UNITS OR STORED IN WAREHOUSES, WHICH IS HELD FOR REMODELING OR REPOSITIONING, IS DEPRECIATED AND IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS PROPERTY, BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT HELD FOR FUTURE USE.  BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT PLACED ON THE MARKET FOR SALE IS NOT DEPRECIATED AND IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS PROPERTY HELD FOR SALE AND RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED. MAJOR EQUIPMENT REFURBISHMENTS AND REMODELING COSTS ARE GENERALLY CAPITALIZED.  THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES REGARDING BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDE CERTAIN MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF SUCH ASSETS, THE RESIDUAL VALUES TO WHICH THE ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES THE LIFE OF EXISTING ASSETS. THESE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MAY PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAN WOULD BE REPORTED IF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED.  INCOME TAXES  OUR CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED TAXABLE INCOME IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AFTER CONSIDERING THE IMPACT ON OUR TAXABLE INCOME OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DISPARATE TREATMENT OF ITEMS, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLOSED RESTAURANTS, ESTIMATED LIABILITIES FOR SELF-INSURANCE, TAX CREDITS AND NET OPERATING LOSSES (\\u201cNOL\\u201d) FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE ALSO PROVIDED FOR NOL AND INCOME TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IS ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT REALIZE SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE TAX BENEFIT OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS. WE EVALUATE, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE BASED UPON RECENT PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, TAX REPORTING POSITIONS, AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. THE DETERMINATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS SUBJECT TO ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES SHOULD CHANGE.  CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET, NET OF EXPECTED REVERSALS OF EXISTING DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.  ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\\u201cASU\\u201d) 2018-18 \\u2013  COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS  (TOPIC 808), WHICH CLARIFIES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TOPIC 808 AND TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2018-18 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THIS STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2021. THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  19  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES UPDATE  ADOPTION OF ASC TOPIC 842: LEASES  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2016-02-  LEASES  (TOPIC 842) AND RELATED AMENDMENTS, AS OF JANUARY 29, 2019, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH PROVIDES A METHOD FOR RECORDING EXISTING LEASES AT ADOPTION WITH A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS WHICH PERMITS THE COMPANY TO NOT REASSESS (1) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES, (2) THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES, AND (3) ANY INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY ALSO ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT LEASE CONSIDERATIONS TO NOT ALLOCATE LEASE CONSIDERATIONS BETWEEN LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR REAL ESTATE LEASES. AS SUCH, REAL ESTATE LEASE CONSIDERATIONS ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE LEASE-COMPONENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR ACCORDINGLY.  THE COMPANY APPLIED A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO EFFECTIVELY ACCOUNT FOR THE OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS; THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE FINANCING LEASES. THE COMPANY EXCLUDES LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE APPLICATION OF TOPIC 842.  ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES OF $14.4 MILLION AND $15.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JANUARY 29, 2019. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPROXIMATE VALUE OF THE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DEFERRED RENT, DEFERRED RENT INCENTIVES, LEASEHOLD INTERESTS AND PREPAID RENT. THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE BEGINNING ACCUMULATED DEFICIT WAS $(501,000) DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMPARATIVE PERIODS CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED AND DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGACY GUIDANCE IN TOPIC 840.  OPERATING LEASES  THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. LEASE AGREEMENTS WILL TYPICALLY EXIST WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS REPRESENTING THE RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM. THE LEASE EXPENSE FOR LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  AS THE COMPANY\\u2019S LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, THE COMPANY WILL USE A SECURED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT LEASE COMMENCEMENT IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS INCLUDE ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE PRIOR TO LEASE COMMENCEMENT AND ARE REDUCED BY ANY LEASE INCENTIVES.  UNDER TOPIC 842, FOR ANY NEW LEASES ENTERED INTO, THE COMPANY WILL ASSESS IF IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE LEASE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE FOR INCLUSION (OR EXCLUSION) IN THE LEASE TERM WHEN THE COMPANY MEASURES THE LEASE LIABILITY. THE DEPRECIABLE LIFE OF ANY ASSETS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE LIMITED BY THE EXPECTED LEASE TERM.  CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING LEASES INCLUDE VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF SALES OVER CONTRACTUAL LEVELS. VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE OBLIGATION FOR THOSE PAYMENTS IS INCURRED. IF SUCH VARIABLE OPERATING LEASES ARISE THAT INCLUDE INCENTIVES FROM LANDLORDS IN THE FORM OF CASH, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE INCENTIVE WHEN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE MET AS A DEFERRED LIABILITY. THE DEFERRED LIABILITY IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS A REDUCTION OF RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE APPLICABLE LEASE, INCLUDING OPTIONS TO EXTEND IF THEY ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO BE EXERCISED. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THOSE LIABILITIES TO BE AMORTIZED WITHIN A YEAR AS A CURRENT LIABILITY AND THOSE GREATER THAN A YEAR AS A LONG-TERM LIABILITY. FOR PURPOSES OF RECOGNIZING THESE INCENTIVES AND RENTAL EXPENSES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, THE COMPANY USES THE DATE IT OBTAINS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE AND CONTROL THE LEASE ASSET TO BEGIN AMORTIZATION, WHICH IS GENERALLY WHEN THE COMPANY TAKES POSSESSION OF THE ASSET. PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 5 \\u2013 OPERATING LEASES IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES RELATED TO LEASES.

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT  AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENT.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $37,889  $35,253  BOMBSHELLS  8,755  7,120  OTHER  383  261  $47,027  $42,634  NIGHTCLUBS  SAME-STORE SALES SLIGHTLY INCREASED BY 0.1% DURING THE QUARTER DUE TO STRONG PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLUBS IN NEW YORK, MINNESOTA AND  TEXAS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN CLUBS IN FLORIDA AND NORTH CAROLINA. SALES FROM NEW CLUBS INCLUDED $2.9 MILLION FROM THE  TWO CLUBS WE ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2018 AND $272,000 FROM A CLUB ACQUIRED IN MAY 2018.  BOMBSHELLS STILL SHOWED NEGATIVE SAME-STORE  SALES FOR THE QUARTER, BUT MONTHLY SEQUENTIAL SAME-STORE SALES HAVE BEEN IMPROVING. JUNE 2019 WAS THE FIRST SAME-STORE  SALES POSITIVE MONTH SINCE MAY 2018, AND JULY 2019 IMPROVED TO A POSITIVE DOUBLE DIGIT. NEWLY OPENED BOMBSHELLS UNITS IN FISCAL  2019 CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  TOTAL  OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A PERCENT OF REVENUES, INCREASED TO 78.8% FROM 77.7% FROM YEAR-AGO, WITH A $3.9 MILLION INCREASE, OR 11.8%.  SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE CHANGES IN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.  COST  OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED BY $835,000, OR 14.2%, MAINLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM NEWLY ACQUIRED CLUBS AND NEWLY CONSTRUCTED  BOMBSHELLS. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED TO 14.2% FROM 13.8% MAINLY DUE TO FOOD COST INEFFICIENCIES  FROM NEWLY OPENED BOMBSHELLS UNITS (26.3% FROM 24.3%), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TIGHTER FOOD COST CONTROL IN NIGHTCLUBS (11.3% FROM  11.6%).  SALARIES  AND WAGES INCREASED BY $1.8 MILLION, OR 15.9%, MAINLY DUE TO NEWLY ACQUIRED AND OPENED UNITS, ESPECIALLY THOSE NEW BOMBSHELLS  OPENING/TRAINING TEAMS WHOSE RESTAURANTS HAVE NOT YET CONTRIBUTED TO THE SALES BASE. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SALARIES  AND WAGES WERE 28.0% FROM 26.7% MAINLY DUE TO NEW BOMBSHELLS OPENING/TRAINING TEAMS.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $1.4 MILLION, OR 10.5%, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN LEGAL EXPENSES, ADVERTISING  AND MARKETING, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, AND CHARGE CARD FEES. LEGAL EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES RELATED TO THE  SEC REVIEW, WHILE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, AND CHARGE CARD FEES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASE IN UNITS.  AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES SLIGHTLY INCREASED TO 31.7% FROM 31.6%.  DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED BY $467,000, OR 23.4% DUE TO HIGHER UNIT COUNT FROM NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ACQUISITIONS.  27  OTHER  CHARGES (GAINS), NET RESULTED TO A NET GAIN OF $172,000 IN THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED TO A NET CHARGE OF $440,000 IN THE PRIOR-YEAR  QUARTER. THE SWING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A NET GAIN FROM SALE OF TWO REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND AN AIRCRAFT DURING THE CURRENT-YEAR  THIRD QUARTER COMPARED TO LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS DURING THE PRIOR-YEAR THIRD QUARTER.  INCOME  FROM OPERATIONS  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, OUR OPERATING MARGIN WAS 21.2% AND 22.3%, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR THE  DECREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE, BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM SALARIES AND WAGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SHIFT  FROM A NET CHARGE TO A NET GAIN OF OTHER CHARGES/GAINS, NET.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $14,034  $12,584  BOMBSHELLS  686  1,391  OTHER  (111  )  (328  )  GENERAL CORPORATE  (4,635  )  (4,155  )  $9,974  $9,492  OPERATING  MARGIN FOR THE NIGHTCLUBS SEGMENT WAS 37.0% AND 35.7% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE OPERATING  MARGIN FOR BOMBSHELLS WAS 7.8% AND 19.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN NIGHTCLUBS OPERATING MARGIN WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE SHIFT  IN OTHER CHARGES/GAINS, NET. THE DECREASE IN BOMBSHELLS OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FIXED OPERATING EXPENSES AND FOOD  COST INEFFICIENCIES ESPECIALLY RELATED TO NEWLY OPENED UNITS. EXCLUDING OTHER GAINS/CHARGES, NIGHTCLUBS WOULD HAVE HAD NON-GAAP  OPERATING MARGIN OF 36.6% AND 35.4% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE BOMBSHELLS WOULD HAVE  HAD NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN OF 7.8% AND 19.5%, RESPECTIVELY.  NON-OPERATING  ITEMS  INTEREST  EXPENSE INCREASED TO $2.5 MILLION FROM $2.3 MILLION DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE MAINLY FROM ACQUISITION-RELATED DEBT, AND  A SLIGHTLY HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATE.  OUR  TOTAL OCCUPANCY COSTS, DEFINED AS THE SUM OF RENT EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WERE 7.5% AND 7.6% OF REVENUE DURING THE QUARTER  ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WERE DUE TO LOWER RENT DOLLARS IN  RELATION TO REVENUES.  INCOME  TAXES  INCOME  TAXES WERE AN EXPENSE OF $1.8 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $1.8 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. ALTHOUGH  INCOME TAX DOLLARS DID NOT HAVE A NOTICEABLE CHANGE, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 WAS AN EXPENSE  OF 24.1% COMPARED TO 25.3% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS AFFECTED BY STATE TAXES, PERMANENT DIFFERENCES,  AND TAX CREDITS, INCLUDING THE FICA TIP CREDIT.  OUR  INCOME TAX EXPENSE DECREASED BY 1.3%, WHILE OUR PRE-TAX INCOME INCREASED BY 3.4%. THIS DISPROPORTIONATE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED  BY THE QUARTERLY IMPACT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAX ACT (SEE BELOW) ON OUR PRIOR-YEAR THIRD QUARTER.  THE  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\\u201cTAX ACT\\u201d) WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, AND INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, A REDUCTION IN  THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. OUR FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL  2018 WAS 24.5% PERCENT AND REPRESENTS A BLENDED INCOME TAX RATE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR FISCAL 2019,  OUR FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE IS 21%.  ADDITIONALLY,  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 740, WE REMEASURED OUR DEFERRED TAX BALANCES TO  REFLECT THE REDUCED RATE THAT WILL APPLY WHEN THESE DEFERRED TAXES ARE SETTLED OR REALIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE REMEASUREMENT  RESULTED IN A $8.7 MILLION FULL YEAR ADJUSTMENT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 AND A CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX BENEFIT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE FISCAL  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE SEC STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118, WHICH ALLOWS COMPANIES TO RECORD PROVISIONAL  AMOUNTS DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD USED WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.  THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL MEASUREMENT ADJUSTMENTS SINCE SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 UNTIL THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD ON DECEMBER  22. 2018.  28  NINE  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  THE  FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).

NIGHTCLUB  SAME-STORE SALES INCREASED BY 1.0%, WHILE BOMBSHELLS SAME-STORE SALES DECREASED BY 13.3%.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL REVENUES WAS AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

BOMBSHELLS  SAME-STORE SALES DECLINE OF 13.3% IMPROVED FROM THE AVERAGE OF THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS DUE TO GRADUALLY IMPROVING SALES CAUSED  BY PRIOR YEAR HIGHER COMPARISONS. NEW BOMBSHELLS STILL NOT IN THE SAME-STORE BASE CONTRIBUTED $8.5 MILLION IN REVENUE FOR THE  PERIOD.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  TOTAL  OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A PERCENT OF REVENUES, DECREASED TO 76.2% FROM 78.5% FROM A YEAR-AGO ALTHOUGH DOLLAR VALUE INCREASED BY  $5.4 MILLION, OR 5.5%. SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE CHANGES IN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.  COST  OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED BY 7.8% MAINLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM NEWLY ACQUIRED CLUBS AND NEWLY CONSTRUCTED BOMBSHELLS.  AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS FLAT AT 13.8% FROM 13.9% MAINLY DUE TO TIGHTER FOOD COST CONTROL IN NIGHTCLUBS  (11.3% FROM 11.9%) OFFSET BY FOOD COST INEFFICIENCIES FROM NEWLY OPENED BOMBSHELLS UNITS (25.7% FROM 24.7%).  SALARIES  AND WAGES INCREASED BY $4.1 MILLION, OR 12.3%, MAINLY DUE TO NEWLY ACQUIRED AND OPENED UNITS, ESPECIALLY THOSE NEW BOMBSHELLS  OPENING/TRAINING TEAMS WHOSE RESTAURANTS HAVE NOT YET CONTRIBUTED TO THE SALES BASE. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SALARIES  AND WAGES WERE 27.4% FROM 26.5% MAINLY DUE TO PRE-OPENING TEAMS ON NEW BOMBSHELLS UNITS.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $4.1 MILLION, OR 10.5%, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN LEGAL EXPENSES, ADVERTISING  AND MARKETING, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, SUPPLIES, CHARGE CARD FEES, AND SECURITY. LEGAL EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES  RELATED TO THE SEC REVIEW, TRIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TWO CASES, AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO CLUBS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  ADVERTISING AND MARKETING INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL EXPENSES FROM ACQUIRED CLUBS AND A NEW MARKETING PROGRAM FOR BOMBSHELLS.  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, SUPPLIES EXPENSE, CHARGE CARD FEES, AND SECURITY INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED UNIT COUNT. AS A PERCENT  OF TOTAL REVENUES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO 31.8% FROM 31.3% MAINLY DUE TO LEGAL EXPENSES.  DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED BY $912,000, OR 15.7% DUE TO HIGHER UNIT COUNT FROM NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ACQUISITIONS.  30  OTHER  CHARGES (GAINS), NET RESULTED TO A NET GAIN OF $2.3 MILLION IN THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD COMPARED TO A NET CHARGE OF $2.8  MILLION IN THE PRIOR-YEAR NINE-MONTH PERIOD. THE SHIFT WAS CAUSED BY THE NET GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION FROM THE SALE  OF SEVERAL REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.6  MILLION AND SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS OF $1.3 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  INCOME  FROM OPERATIONS  FOR  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, OUR OPERATING MARGIN WAS 23.8% AND 21.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR THE  INCREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE, BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE SHIFT FROM A NET CHARGE TO A NET GAIN OF OTHER  CHARGES/GAINS, NET.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW (IN THOUSANDS).

THE INCREASE IN NIGHTCLUBS OPERATING MARGIN WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE NET  GAIN IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE NET CHARGES IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN BOMBSHELLS OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO FIXED SALARIES AND WAGES AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DELEVERAGED FROM NEGATIVE SAME-STORE SALES.  NON-OPERATING  ITEMS  INTEREST  EXPENSE INCREASED TO $7.7 MILLION FROM $7.5 MILLION, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE PARTIALLY OFFSET  BY LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATE.  OUR TOTAL OCCUPANCY COSTS, DEFINED AS THE  SUM OF RENT EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, EXCLUSIVE OF PRIOR-YEAR REFINANCING-RELATED COSTS ABOVE, WERE 7.8% AND 7.6% OF REVENUE  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE HIGHER OCCUPANCY COSTS WERE DUE TO THE INTEREST EXPENSE  INCURRED AT SEVERAL BOMBSHELLS UNITS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, WHICH DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO REVENUE, AND THE DEBT INCURRED ON THE TWO  NOVEMBER 2018 CLUB ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE.  AS  PART OF OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01, WE RECORDED A $370,000 NET UNREALIZED LOSS ON THE MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES DURING  THE CURRENT YEAR. THE CUMULATIVE NET GAIN IN MARKET VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR SALE SECURITIES, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL  YEAR 2019.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD OF 2019 WAS AN EXPENSE OF 22.8% COMPARED TO A  BENEFIT OF 25.0% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS AFFECTED BY STATE TAXES, PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND TAX  CREDITS, INCLUDING THE FICA TIP CREDIT, FOR BOTH YEARS WHILE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY A $9.7 MILLION  REDUCTION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY CAUSED BY NEWLY ENACTED TAX LAWS.  THE  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\\u201cTAX ACT\\u201d) WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, AND INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, A REDUCTION IN  THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. OUR FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL  2018 WAS 24.5% PERCENT AND REPRESENTS A BLENDED INCOME TAX RATE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR FISCAL 2019,  OUR FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE IS 21%.  ADDITIONALLY,  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 740, WE REMEASURED OUR DEFERRED TAX BALANCES TO  REFLECT THE REDUCED RATE THAT WILL APPLY WHEN THESE DEFERRED TAXES ARE SETTLED OR REALIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE REMEASUREMENT  RESULTED IN A $8.7 MILLION FULL YEAR ADJUSTMENT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 AND A CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX BENEFIT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE FISCAL  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

WE MONITOR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BECAUSE IT DESCRIBES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF  THE COMPANY AND HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS GAUGE OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FLOW, EXCLUDING (OR INCLUDING) SOME ITEMS THAT  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, BUT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED  FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURES CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. RELATIVE TO EACH OF THE NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES, WE FURTHER SET FORTH OUR RATIONALE AS FOLLOWS.  NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME AND NON-GAAP  OPERATING MARGIN.  WE CALCULATE NON-GAAP OPERATING  INCOME AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN BY EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ITEMS FROM INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN: (A)  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (B) IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, (C) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS,  (D) GAINS OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE, AND (E) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS ASSISTS  INVESTORS IN EVALUATING PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD CHANGES IN OUR OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT  ARE NOT A RESULT OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.  NON-GAAP  NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE  . WE CALCULATE NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER DILUTED  SHARE BY EXCLUDING OR INCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND DILUTED EARNINGS  PER SHARE. ADJUSTMENT ITEMS ARE: (A) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (B) IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, (C) COSTS AND  CHARGES RELATED TO DEBT REFINANCING, (D) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (E) GAINS OR LOSSES  ON INSURANCE, (F) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, (G) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS, AND (H) THE INCOME  TAX EFFECT OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED ADJUSTMENTS. INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX EFFECT OF THE ABOVE ADJUSTMENTS IS THE NET  EFFECT OF THE NON-GAAP PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, CALCULATED AT 22.8% AND 26.5% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF THE PRE-TAX NON-GAAP  INCOME BEFORE TAXES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE GAAP INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT).  WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING AND INCLUDING SUCH ITEMS HELP MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  ADJUSTED  EBITDA  . WE CALCULATE ADJUSTED EBITDA BY EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ITEMS FROM NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS.  (A) DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, (B) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (C) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT), (D) NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, (E) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (F) GAINS OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE,  (G) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, AND (H) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTING FOR  SUCH ITEMS HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES. ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES A CORE OPERATIONAL  PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT THAT COMPARES RESULTS WITHOUT THE NEED TO ADJUST FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHICH HAVE CONSIDERABLE  VARIATION BETWEEN DOMESTIC JURISDICTIONS. THE RESULTS ARE, THEREFORE, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF FINANCING ALTERNATIVES OF CAPITAL  EMPLOYED. WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS ONE GUIDELINE TO ASSESS OUR UNLEVERAGED PERFORMANCE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA  IS ALSO THE TARGET BENCHMARK FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS OF NIGHTCLUBS.  WE  ALSO USE CERTAIN NON-GAAP CASH FLOW MEASURES SUCH AS FREE CASH FLOW. SEE \\u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\u201d SECTION  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  32  THE  FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT OUR NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS,  EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND PERCENTAGES).

THE  ADJUSTMENTS TO RECONCILE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME EXCLUDE THE IMPACT  OF ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, WHICH IS IMMATERIAL.  33  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  WERE APPROXIMATELY $11.0 MILLION COMPARED TO $17.7 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF CASH WE HANDLE,  WE HAVE VERY STRINGENT CASH CONTROLS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $5.4 MILLION COMPARED TO  A POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $55,000 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, EXCLUDING ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OF $2.9 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER  30, 2018. WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL STRENGTHS. OUR  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $28.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $22.4 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR OUR BUSINESS REMAINS STRONG, AND WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THIS REPORT. AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPECTED CASH FLOWS  FROM OPERATIONS, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO MEET OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS.  WE  HAVE NOT RECENTLY RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES. INSTEAD, WE USE DEBT FINANCING TO LOWER OUR OVERALL  COST OF CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR RETURN ON STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF BORROWING FUNDS IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS  AND FROM SELLERS IN ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS, AND HAVE RECENTLY SECURED TRADITIONAL BANK FINANCING ON OUR NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  AND REFINANCING OF OUR EXISTING NOTES PAYABLE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES FROM  THOSE SOURCES. WE ALSO HAVE HISTORICALLY UTILIZED THESE CASH FLOWS TO INVEST IN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, ADULT NIGHTCLUBS AND RESTAURANTS/SPORTS  BARS.  THE  FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $28,414  $22,411  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (25,608  )  (18,564  )  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (9,576  )  (598  )  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(6,770  )  $3,249  CASH  FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FOLLOWING  ARE OUR SUMMARIZED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (IN THOUSANDS).

FOR  THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NEW FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT  $14,829  $16,980  MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  2,072  1,847  TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  $16,901  $18,827  THE  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WERE COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  FOR FOUR NEW LOCATIONS, WHILE THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WERE COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF CONSTRUCTION  AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR ONE NEW LOCATION AND PURCHASE OF REAL ESTATE FOR THREE BOMBSHELLS LOCATIONS. VARIANCES IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NUMBER AND TIMING OF NEW, REMODELED, OR RECONCEPTED LOCATIONS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  ACQUISITIONS OF $13.5 MILLION, EXCLUDING  ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 RELATE TO $7.5 MILLION CASH PAID ON THE PITTSBURGH  CLUB ACQUISITION AND THE $6.0 MILLION CASH PAID ON THE CHICAGO CLUB ACQUISITION.  CASH  FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOLLOWING  ARE OUR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM DEBT  $12,330  $72,387  PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT  (18,634  )  (70,444  )  DEBT PREPAYMENT PENALTY  -  (543  )  PURCHASE OF TREASURY STOCK  (2,364  )  -  PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS  (867  )  (876  )  PAYMENT OF LOAN ORIGINATION COSTS  (20  )  (960  )  DISTRIBUTION TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  (21  )  (162  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(9,576  )  $(598  )  WE  PURCHASED 102,113 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $23.15 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WHILE WE  DID NOT PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. WE PAID QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF $0.03  PER SHARE DURING EACH OF THE CURRENT- AND PRIOR-YEAR QUARTERS.  35  ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, THE COMPANY  RAISED $2.35 MILLION THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF 12% UNSECURED PROMISSORY NOTES TO CERTAIN INVESTORS, WHICH NOTES MATURE ON  NOVEMBER 1, 2021. THE NOTES PAY INTEREST-ONLY IN EQUAL MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS, WITH A LUMP SUM PRINCIPAL PAYMENT AT MATURITY.  AMONG THE PROMISSORY NOTES ARE TWO NOTES WITH A PRINCIPAL OF $450,000 AND $200,000. THE $450,000 NOTE WAS IN EXCHANGE FOR A  $300,000 12% NOTE AND THE $200,000 NOTE WAS IN EXCHANGE FOR A $100,000 NOTE, BOTH OF WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAY 1, 2017  FINANCING TO ACQUIRE SCARLETT\\u2019S CABARET IN MIAMI. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE $2.35 MILLION BORROWING IS A $500,000 NOTE  BORROWED FROM A RELATED PARTY AND TWO NOTES TOTALING $400,000 BORROWED FROM A NON-OFFICER EMPLOYEE AND A FAMILY MEMBER OF  A NON-OFFICER EMPLOYEE IN WHICH THE TERMS OF THE NOTES ARE THE SAME AS THE REST OF THE LENDER GROUP. SEE NOTES 6 AND 13 TO  OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ON  DECEMBER 6, 2018, THE COMPANY AMENDED THE $5.0 MILLION SHORT-TERM NOTE PAYABLE RELATED TO THE SCARLETT\\u2019S ACQUISITION, WHICH  HAD A REMAINING BALANCE OF $3.0 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 6, 2018, EXTENDING THE MATURITY DATE FROM MAY 8, 2019, AS PREVIOUSLY AMENDED,  TO MAY 8, 2020. SEE NOTE 6 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ON  DECEMBER 11, 2018, THE COMPANY PURCHASED AN AIRCRAFT FOR $2.8 MILLION WITH A $554,000 DOWN PAYMENT AND FINANCED THE REMAINING  $2.2 MILLION WITH A 5.49% PROMISSORY NOTE PAYABLE IN 20 YEARS WITH MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF $15,118, INCLUDING INTEREST.  ON  FEBRUARY 8, 2019, THE COMPANY REFINANCED A ONE-YEAR BANK NOTE WITH A BALANCE OF $1.5 MILLION, BEARING AN INTEREST RATE OF 6.1%,  WITH A CONSTRUCTION LOAN WITH ANOTHER BANK, WHICH HAS AN INTEREST RATE OF 6.0% ADJUSTED AFTER FIVE YEARS TO PRIME PLUS 0.5% WITH  A 6.0% FLOOR PER ANNUM. THE NEW CONSTRUCTION LOAN, WHICH HAS A MAXIMUM AVAILABILITY OF $4.1 MILLION, MATURES IN 252 MONTHS FROM  CLOSING DATE AND IS PAYABLE INTEREST-ONLY FOR THE FIRST 12 MONTHS, THEN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF $29,571 MONTHLY FOR THE NEXT  48 MONTHS, AND THE REMAINING TERM MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST BASED ON THE ADJUSTED INTEREST RATE. THE COMPANY  PAID APPROXIMATELY $69,000 IN LOAN COSTS OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $19,600 WAS CAPITALIZED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON THE NEW CONSTRUCTION  LOAN WITH THE REMAINING CHARGED TO INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO WROTE OFF THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  OF THE OLD BANK NOTE TO INTEREST EXPENSE.  INCLUDED IN THE BALANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 IS A $200,000 NOTE, THAT IS A PART OF THE MAY 1, 2017 FINANCING, BORROWED FROM A NON-OFFICER  EMPLOYEE IN WHICH THE TERMS OF THE NOTE ARE THE SAME AS THE REST OF THE LENDER GROUP.  MANAGEMENT  ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP CASH FLOW MEASURES SUCH AS FREE CASH FLOW. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES LESS MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE USE FREE CASH FLOW AS THE BASELINE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CAPITAL  ALLOCATION STRATEGY.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $28,414  $22,411  LESS: MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  2,072  1,847  FREE CASH FLOW  $26,342  $20,564  OUR  FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE CURRENT-YEAR NINE-MONTH PERIOD INCREASED BY 28.1% COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THOUGH  WE GENERATED A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF FREE CASH FLOW DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE STILL ENDED WITH A NET DECREASE  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS FROM THE MOST RECENT YEAR-END DUE TO OUR ACQUISITION OF TWO NEW CLUBS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW  BOMBSHELLS UNITS.  OTHER  THAN THE NOTES PAYABLE FINANCING DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY EVENT OR TREND THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANTLY  AFFECT LIQUIDITY. IN THE EVENT SUCH A TREND DEVELOPS, WE BELIEVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS WILL  BE ADEQUATELY MET BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. IN OUR OPINION, WORKING CAPITAL IS NOT A TRUE INDICATOR OF OUR FINANCIAL STATUS.  TYPICALLY, BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY CARRY CURRENT LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF CURRENT ASSETS BECAUSE BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY  RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY IMMEDIATE PAYMENT FOR SALES, WITH NOMINAL RECEIVABLES, WHILE INVENTORIES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES NORMALLY  CARRY LONGER PAYMENT TERMS. VENDORS AND PURVEYORS OFTEN REMAIN FLEXIBLE WITH PAYMENT TERMS, PROVIDING BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY  WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO ADJUST TO SHORT-TERM BUSINESS DOWN TURNS. WE CONSIDER THE PRIMARY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL STATUS TO BE THE  LONG-TERM TREND OF REVENUE GROWTH, THE MIX OF SALES REVENUES, OVERALL CASH FLOW, PROFITABILITY FROM OPERATIONS AND THE LEVEL OF  LONG-TERM DEBT.  36  THE  FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF SUCH INDICATORS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30.  INCREASE  INCREASE  2019  (DECREASE)  2018  (DECREASE)  2017  SALES OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES  $56,366  6.7%  $52,835  19.8%  $44,085  SALES OF FOOD AND MERCHANDISE  19,175  13.4%  16,906  28.1%  13,201  SERVICE REVENUES  51,609  6.8%  48,338  12.4%  42,995  OTHER  8,726  24.8%  6,993  29.4%  5,405  TOTAL REVENUES  135,876  8.6%  125,072  18.3%  105,686  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $28,414  26.8%  $22,411  25.2%  $17,897  ADJUSTED EBITDA*  $36,631  3.4%  $35,432  27.8%  $27,715  FREE CASH FLOW*  $26,342  28.1%  $20,564  23.9%  $16,592  LONG-TERM DEBT (END OF PERIOD)  $146,579  11.7%  $131,255  4.8%  $125,268  *  SEE DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW ABOVE IN THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SUBSECTION OF RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS.  SHARE  REPURCHASE  WE  PURCHASED 102,113 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $23.15 PER SHARE DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  WHILE WE DID NOT PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. IN JANUARY 2019, THE COMPANY\\u2019S BOARD  OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $10.0 MILLION TO REPURCHASE THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAVE  $10.8 MILLION REMAINING TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  OTHER  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED FINANCING OTHER THAN THE NOTES PAYABLE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE, IF AT ALL, SHOULD THE  NEED ARISE.  WE  BELIEVE THAT THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY STANDARD OF TREATING ENTERTAINERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS PROVIDES US WITH SAFE  HARBOR PROTECTION TO PRECLUDE PAYROLL TAX ASSESSMENT FOR PRIOR YEARS. WE HAVE PREPARED PLANS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROTECT OUR  PROFITABILITY IN THE EVENT THAT THE SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INDUSTRY IS REQUIRED IN ALL STATES TO CONVERT DANCERS WHO ARE NOW  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INTO EMPLOYEES.  THE  SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO PRICE, SERVICE AND LOCATION, AS WELL AS THE PROFESSIONALISM  OF THE ENTERTAINMENT. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE FUTURE, THERE CAN  BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR HIGH LEVEL OF NAME RECOGNITION AND PRESTIGE WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE.  IMPACT  OF INFLATION  WE  HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL OVERALL IMPACT FROM INFLATION IN OUR OPERATIONS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED  BY COMPETITION, WE HAVE MANAGED TO RECOVER INCREASED COSTS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO. HOWEVER, THERE CAN  BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  37  SEASONALITY  OUR  NIGHTCLUB OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED REDUCED REVENUES FROM APRIL THROUGH SEPTEMBER  (OUR FISCAL THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS) WITH THE STRONGEST OPERATING RESULTS OCCURRING DURING OCTOBER THROUGH MARCH (OUR FISCAL  FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS). OUR REVENUES IN CERTAIN MARKETS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY SPORTING EVENTS THAT CAUSE UNUSUAL CHANGES IN  SALES FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  CAPITAL  ALLOCATION STRATEGY  OUR  CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY PROVIDES US WITH DISCIPLINED GUIDELINES ON HOW WE SHOULD USE OUR FREE CASH FLOWS; PROVIDED HOWEVER,  THAT WE MAY DEVIATE FROM THIS STRATEGY IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING  ACTIVITIES MINUS MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. USING THE AFTER-TAX YIELD OF BUYING OUR OWN STOCK AS BASELINE, WE BELIEVE WE  ARE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER INVESTMENT DECISIONS UNLESS THERE IS ANOTHER STRATEGIC RATIONALE, IN MANAGEMENT\\u2019S OPINION.  BASED  ON OUR CURRENT CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY.  \\u25cf  WE  CONSIDER BUYING BACK OUR OWN STOCK IF THE AFTER-TAX YIELD ON FREE CASH FLOW CLIMBS OVER 10%;  \\u25cf  WE  CONSIDER DISPOSING OF UNDERPERFORMING UNITS TO FREE UP CAPITAL FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE USE;  \\u25cf  WE  CONSIDER ACQUIRING OR DEVELOPING OUR OWN CLUBS OR RESTAURANTS THAT WE BELIEVE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM CASH  ON CASH RETURN OF 25%-33%, ABSENT AN OTHERWISE STRATEGIC RATIONALE;  \\u25cf  WE  CONSIDER PAYING DOWN OUR MOST EXPENSIVE DEBT IF IT MAKES SENSE ON A TAX ADJUSTED BASIS, OR THERE IS AN OTHERWISE STRATEGIC  RATIONALE.  GROWTH  STRATEGY  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR NIGHTCLUB OPERATIONS CAN CONTINUE TO GROW ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH CAREFUL ENTRY INTO MARKETS AND DEMOGRAPHIC  SEGMENTS WITH HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING: (I) TO ACQUIRE EXISTING UNITS IN LOCATIONS THAT  ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR GROWTH AND INCOME TARGETS AND WHICH APPEAR RECEPTIVE TO THE UPSCALE CLUB FORMULA WE HAVE DEVELOPED; (II)  TO OPEN NEW UNITS AFTER MARKET ANALYSIS; (III) TO FRANCHISE OUR BOMBSHELLS BRAND; (IV) TO FORM JOINT VENTURES OR PARTNERSHIPS  TO REDUCE START-UP AND OPERATING COSTS, WITH US CONTRIBUTING EQUITY IN THE FORM OF OUR BRAND NAME AND MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE; (V)  TO DEVELOP NEW CLUB CONCEPTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR MANAGEMENT AND MARKETING SKILLS; (VI) TO DEVELOP AND OPEN OUR RESTAURANT  CONCEPTS AS OUR CAPITAL AND MANPOWER ALLOW; AND (VII) TO CONTROL THE REAL ESTATE IN CONNECTION WITH CLUB OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH  SOME UNITS MAY BE IN LEASED PREMISES.  WE  BELIEVE THAT BOMBSHELLS CAN GROW ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH CAREFUL ENTRY INTO MARKETS AND DEMOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS WITH HIGH GROWTH  POTENTIAL. ALL SEVEN OF THE CURRENTLY EXISTING BOMBSHELLS ARE LOCATED IN TEXAS. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY IS TO DIVERSIFY OUR OPERATIONS  WITH THESE UNITS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE SOB LICENSES, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. WHILE WE ARE SEARCHING FOR ADULT  NIGHTCLUBS TO ACQUIRE, WE ARE ABLE TO ALSO SEARCH FOR RESTAURANT/SPORTS BAR LOCATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INCOME TARGETS.  WE OPENED TWO BOMBSHELLS IN FISCAL  2019, ONE THAT OPENED IN DECEMBER 2018 AND ANOTHER THAT OPENED IN MARCH 2019. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO BOMBSHELLS PROJECTS UNDER  CONSTRUCTION, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OPEN IN EARLY FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  WE  CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE NEW NIGHTCLUBS AND ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING NEW LOCATIONS THAT FIT OUR BUSINESS MODEL  AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST.

ORGANIC SALES INCREASED 1%.  \\u2022  FOOD SAFETY SEGMENT SALES WERE $51.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, A DECREASE OF 2% COMPARED TO $52.2 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. ORGANIC SALES IN THIS SEGMENT ALSO DECREASED 2%, AFTER EXCLUDING A MINOR CONTRIBUTION FROM THE AUGUST 1, 2018 ACQUISITION OF CLARUS LABS.  \\u2022  ANIMAL SAFETY SEGMENT SALES WERE $50.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AN INCREASE OF 6% COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER SALES OF $47.4 MILLION. ORGANIC SALES IN THIS SEGMENT INCREASED 5%, WITH THE ACQUISITIONS OF LIVESTOCK GENETICS (SEPTEMBER 2018) AND DELTA GENOMICS (JANUARY 2019) PROVIDING THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE.  \\u2022  INTERNATIONAL SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE 37.5% OF TOTAL SALES COMPARED TO 39.9% OF TOTAL SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \\u2022  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 17.0% COMPARED TO AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 11.1% IN THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER. THE PRIOR YEAR\\u2019S FIRST QUARTER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTIONS.  \\u2022  NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $14.7 MILLION, OR $0.28 PER DILUTED SHARE, A DECREASE OF 4% COMPARED TO $15.2 MILLION, OR $0.29 PER SHARE, FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \\u2022  CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $23.7 MILLION, COMPARED TO $16.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  NEOGEN\\u2019S RESULTS REFLECT A 4% DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. INTERNATIONAL GROWTH IN THIS QUARTER WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY CURRENCY RATES, THE LOSS OF FORENSICS BUSINESS IN BRAZIL AND A LARGE PRIOR YEAR  NON-RECURRING  GOVERNMENT SALE, ALSO IN BRAZIL. REVENUE CHANGES, EXPRESSED IN PERCENTAGES, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR ARE AS FOLLOWS FOR EACH OF OUR INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS.

NEOGEN EUROPE\\u2019S 4% DECLINE IN REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 2% DECREASE IN SALES OF NATURAL TOXINS TEST KITS; PRIOR YEAR SALES IN THIS CATEGORY WERE ENHANCED DUE TO A MILD DEOXYNIVALENOL (DON) OUTBREAK IN FRANCE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED TESTING IN THAT PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED A LARGE EQUIPMENT SALE THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT YEAR. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE DECLINES WERE STRONG SALES OF CLEANERS AND DISINFECTANTS.  AT OUR BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS, THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER INCLUDED THE FINAL SHIPMENT OF A LARGE  NON-RECURRING  INSECTICIDE ORDER TO A GOVERNMENT HEALTH ORGANIZATION. ADDITIONALLY, FORENSIC SALES IN BRAZIL DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO LOST BUSINESS FROM A LARGE COMMERCIAL LABORATORY THAT CONVERTED THEIR TESTING PROTOCOL TO  A HIGHER THROUGHPUT METHOD  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE LOWER REVENUES, SALES OF OUR AFLATOXIN TEST KITS ROSE 57% AS WE CONTINUED TO GAIN MARKET SHARE OF CORN TESTING IN BRAZIL. AT NEOGEN LATINOAMERICA, THE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER WAS LED BY SALES OF NATURAL TOXINS TEST KITS DUE TO MARKET SHARE GAINS  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF BIOSECURITY PRODUCTS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SERVICE REVENUE, WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF GENOMICS SERVICES TO ANIMAL PROTEIN AND COMPANION ANIMAL MARKETS, WAS $19.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF 17% OVER PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER REVENUES OF $16.7 MILLION, WITH MINOR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF LIVESTOCK GENETICS (SEPTEMBER 2018) AND DELTA GENOMICS (JANUARY 2019). THE GROWTH WAS LED BY INCREASES OF GENOMIC TESTING SERVICE REVENUES TO THE COMPANION ANIMAL AND GLOBAL BEEF AND DAIRY CATTLE MARKETS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31,  INCREASE/  2019  2018  (DECREASE)%  (IN THOUSANDS)  FOOD SAFETY  NATURAL TOXINS, ALLERGENS & DRUG RESIDUES  $20,115  $18,838  $1,277  7%  BACTERIAL & GENERAL SANITATION  10,316  10,467  (151  )  (1  )%  CULTURE MEDIA & OTHER  11,279  12,217  (938  )  (8  )%  RODENTICIDES, INSECTICIDES & DISINFECTANTS  5,449  6,625  (1,176  )  (18  )%  GENOMICS SERVICES  3,862  4,036  (174  )  (4  )%  $51,021  $52,183  $(1,162  )  (2  )%  ANIMAL SAFETY  LIFE SCIENCES  $1,723  $2,080  $(357  )  (17  )%  VETERINARY INSTRUMENTS & DISPOSABLES  11,336  10,404  932  9%  ANIMAL CARE & OTHER  6,405  6,398  7  0%  RODENTICIDES, INSECTICIDES & DISINFECTANTS  16,718  17,146  (428  )  (2  )%  GENOMICS SERVICES  14,221  11,415  2,806  25%  $50,403  $47,443  $2,960  6%  TOTAL REVENUES  $101,424  $99,626  $1,798  2%  FOOD SAFETY  NATURAL TOXINS, ALLERGENS & DRUG RESIDUES \\u2013  SALES IN THIS CATEGORY INCREASED 7% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, LED BY A 9% INCREASE IN SALES OF NATURAL TOXINS TEST KITS PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET SHARE GAINS OF AFLATOXIN KITS IN BRAZIL. SALES OF ALLERGEN TEST KITS INCREASED 8% WHILE SALES OF DAIRY DRUG RESIDUE TEST KITS DECREASED 3%.  BACTERIAL & GENERAL SANITATION \\u2013  REVENUES IN THIS CATEGORY DECREASED 1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER, DUE TO LOWER EQUIPMENT SALES COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR, RESULTING FROM BACKORDERS OF EQUIPMENT FROM OUR PRIMARY SUPPLIER. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECREASE WAS A 12% INCREASE IN SALES OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PRODUCT LINE AND A 20% INCREASE IN SALES OF  LISTERIA  TEST KITS, AS WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE WITH OUR  LISTERIA  RIGHT NOW TEST KIT.  CULTURE MEDIA & OTHER \\u2013  SALES IN THIS CATEGORY DECREASED 8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES SALES OF FORENSIC TEST KITS SOLD WITHIN BRAZIL, WHICH DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, AS A LARGE CUSTOMER MOVED TO  A HIGHER THROUGHPUT METHOD  . SALES OF NEOGEN CULTURE MEDIA WERE DOWN 4%, DUE PRIMARILY TO ORDER TIMING FROM A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS AND LARGE U.S. CUSTOMERS.  RODENTICIDES, INSECTICIDES & DISINFECTANTS \\u2013  SALES OF PRODUCTS IN THIS CATEGORY SOLD THROUGH OUR FOOD SAFETY OPERATIONS DECREASED 18% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE DECREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE FINAL SHIPMENT OF A LARGE  NON-RECURRING  INSECTICIDE ORDER TO A GOVERNMENT HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN BRAZIL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. A DECLINE IN DISINFECTANT SALES IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND RODENTICIDE SALES IN MEXICO, BOTH DUE TO ORDER TIMING FROM DISTRIBUTORS, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN THIS CATEGORY IN THE FIRST QUARTER. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS WAS A 6% INCREASE IN SALES AT U.K.-BASED QUAT-CHEM AND AN INCREASE IN SALES OF DISINFECTANT PRODUCTS IN CHINA, THE RESULT OF INCREASED DEMAND IN THE PORK MARKET CAUSED BY THE AFRICAN SWINE FEVER VIRUS OUTBREAK IN THAT COUNTRY.  GENOMICS SERVICES \\u2013  SALES OF GENOMICS SERVICES SOLD THROUGH OUR FOOD SAFETY OPERATIONS DECREASED 4% IN THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IS DUE TO LOWER SALES IN CHINA, AS TESTING IN THE PORK INDUSTRY DECLINED DUE TO ANIMAL LOSSES SUFFERED AS THE RESULT OF THE AFRICAN SWINE FEVER VIRUS. THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE BRITISH POUND ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE; IN LOCAL CURRENCY, GENOMICS SALES THROUGH OUR NEOGEN EUROPE OPERATION INCREASED 4%.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANIMAL SAFETY  LIFE SCIENCES \\u2013  SALES IN THIS CATEGORY DECREASED 17% IN THE FIRST QUARTER. THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER INCLUDED SALES TO A COMMERCIAL LABORATORY CUSTOMER THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO OUR BRAZILIAN OPERATION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  VETERINARY INSTRUMENTS & DISPOSABLES \\u2013  REVENUES IN THIS CATEGORY INCREASED 9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, LED BY GROWTH IN DISPOSABLE SYRINGES AND MARKING PRODUCTS DUE TO MARKET SHARE GAINS, OFFSETTING A 17% DECREASE IN DETECTABLE NEEDLES.  ANIMAL CARE & OTHER \\u2013  SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS WERE FLAT IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS WITH DISTRIBUTORS ARE RECORDED AS A CONTRA REVENUE WITHIN THIS CATEGORY. ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE AMOUNTS, WHICH CAN VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER, RESULTED IN A HIGHER REDUCTION OF REVENUE IN THE CURRENT YEAR FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OFFSETTING THIS, SALES OF OUR ANIMAL CARE PRODUCT LINES INCREASED 10%.  RODENTICIDES, INSECTICIDES & DISINFECTANTS \\u2013  SALES IN THIS CATEGORY DECREASED 2% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. RODENTICIDE SALES WERE DOWN 8%, AS DEMAND DECLINED DUE TO WEAK RODENT PRESSURE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE U.S. INSECTICIDE SALES INCREASED 6%, AND CLEANERS AND DISINFECTANTS SALES WERE FLAT AS GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS OFFSET BY LOWER SALES TO INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS.  GENOMICS SERVICES \\u2013  SALES IN THIS CATEGORY INCREASED 25% IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AIDED BY MINOR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE LIVESTOCK GENETICS (SEPTEMBER 2018) AND DELTA GENOMICS (JANUARY 2019) ACQUISITIONS; ORGANIC GROWTH IN THIS CATEGORY WAS 21%. THE GROWTH WAS LED BY INCREASES OF SALES TO THE COMPANION ANIMAL AND BEEF AND DAIRY CATTLE MARKETS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SHEEP TESTING BUSINESS IN AUSTRALIA.  GROSS MARGIN  GROSS MARGIN WAS 47.5% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 46.9% IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. ANIMAL SAFETY GROSS MARGINS IMPROVED BY 130 BASIS POINTS, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED GROSS MARGINS IN THE DOMESTIC GENOMICS TESTING SERVICE BUSINESS, WHILE GROSS MARGINS IN THE FOOD SAFETY SEGMENT ROSE BY 50 BASIS POINTS, ON HIGHER SALES OF NATURAL TOXIN TEST KITS, AND DECREASED SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $31.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $30.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AN INCREASE OF $1.6 MILLION, OR 6%. SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES WERE $17.5 MILLION, COMPARED TO $17.2 MILLION IN LAST YEAR\\u2019S FIRST QUARTER, AN INCREASE OF 2%, IN LINE WITH THE REVENUE INCREASE. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASED $501,000, OR 5%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES, DEPRECIATION RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $3.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AN INCREASE OF $869,000 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT SPENDING ON A NUMBER OF NEW PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE LAUNCHED IN LATE FISCAL 2020 AND EARLY FISCAL 2021.  OPERATING INCOME  OPERATING INCOME WAS $16.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER, COMPARED TO $16.5 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME WAS 16.0% COMPARED TO 16.5% IN LAST YEAR\\u2019S FIRST QUARTER. THE DECLINE IN OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE COMPARATIVE QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IN THE CURRENT QUARTER.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER INCOME  THREE MONTHS  ENDED AUGUST 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  INTEREST INCOME (NET OF EXPENSE)  $1,510  $927  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS  (117  )  (386  )  ROYALTY INCOME  1  22  DEOXI CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION  \\u2014  (9  )  OTHER  (7  )  104  TOTAL OTHER INCOME  $1,387  $658  THE INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER IS THE RESULT OF HIGHER CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES  AND HIGHER YIELDS ON THOSE BALANCES.  OTHER EXPENSE RESULTING FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE DOLLAR IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE; ALL OF THE CURRENCIES IN THOSE COUNTRIES DEPRECIATED AGAINST THE DOLLAR DURING THE COMPARATIVE QUARTERS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $3.0 MILLION, AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 17.0%, COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $1.9 MILLION, AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 11.1%. FOR EACH QUARTER, THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21% AND THE EFFECTIVE RATES RECORDED IS THE BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS; THIS BENEFIT WAS $769,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO $2.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET INCOME  NET INCOME WAS $14.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $15.2 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE DECLINE IN EARNINGS WAS THE RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WHICH WAS CAUSED BY DECREASED TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS, DUE TO LOWER OPTION EXERCISE ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO.  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  THE OVERALL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES POSITION OF NEOGEN WAS $291.0 MILLION AT AUGUST 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $267.5 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2019. APPROXIMATELY $23.7 MILLION WAS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. NET CASH PROCEEDS OF $8.7 MILLION WERE REALIZED FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND ISSUANCE OF SHARES UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. WE SPENT $6.5 MILLION FOR PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND OTHER  NON-CURRENT  ASSETS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES WERE $79.1 MILLION AT AUGUST 31, 2019, A DECLINE OF $3.5 MILLION, COMPARED TO $82.6 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2019.

ALL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS ARE ACTIVELY MANAGED AND NO LOSSES IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS RESERVED ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED.  NET INVENTORY BALANCES WERE $87.7 MILLION AT AUGUST 31, 2019, AN INCREASE OF $1.7 MILLION, OR 2%, COMPARED TO MAY 31, 2019 BALANCES OF $86.0 MILLION. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR INVENTORY LEVELS, AND BALANCE THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE LEVELS OF PRODUCT AVAILABILITY TO MINIMIZE BACKORDERS WITH A DESIRE TO IMPROVE INVENTORY TURNS. WE HAVE CONTINUED WITH OUR ACTIVE PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE OUR TURNOVER IN FISCAL 2020.  INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OPERATIONS, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN OFFSETTING INCREASED INPUT COSTS WITH PRICE INCREASES AND/OR COST EFFICIENCIES.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT OUR EXISTING CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES AT AUGUST 31, 2019, ALONG WITH AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY AND CASH EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ACTIVITIES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, EXISTING CASH AND BORROWING CAPACITY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS TO COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT OR ITS PLANS TO ACQUIRE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS THAT FIT WITHIN OUR MISSION STATEMENT.

WE CAUTION THAT THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AND THOSE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INVOLVE MATERIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL AS DISCUSSED HEREIN AND IN ITEM 1A OF OUR FISCAL 2018 FORM 10-K. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  20  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE.  COMPARABLE SALES  \\u2014 COMPARABLE SALES PROVIDE A MEASURE OF SALES GROWTH FOR STORES AND CHANNELS OPEN AT LEAST ONE YEAR OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. IN FISCAL YEARS FOLLOWING THOSE WITH 53 WEEKS, THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD IS SHIFTED BY ONE WEEK TO COMPARE SIMILAR CALENDAR WEEKS. A STORE IS INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES IN THE THIRTEENTH MONTH OF OPERATION. HOWEVER, STORES THAT HAVE A GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE CHANGE OF 25% OR GREATER DUE TO A REMODEL ARE REMOVED FROM THE COMPARABLE SALES BASE, BUT ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL SALES. THESE STORES ARE RETURNED TO THE COMPARABLE SALES BASE IN THE THIRTEENTH MONTH FOLLOWING THE REMODEL. SALES FROM AMERICAN EAGLE, AERIE, TAILGATE AND TODD SNYDER STORES, AS WELL AS SALES FROM AEO DIRECT AND OTHER DIGITAL CHANNELS, ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES. SALES FROM LICENSED STORES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES. INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN EAGLE AND AERIE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES DISCLOSURES REPRESENT SALES FROM STORES AND AEO DIRECT.  AEO DIRECT SALES ARE INCLUDED IN THE INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN EAGLE AND AERIE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES METRIC FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  \\u2022  OUR APPROACH TO CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT IS \\u201cOMNI-CHANNEL,\\u201d WHICH PROVIDES A SEAMLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THROUGH BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, INCLUDING FOUR WALL STORE LOCATIONS, WEB, MOBILE/TABLET DEVICES, SOCIAL NETWORKS, EMAIL, IN-STORE DISPLAYS AND KIOSKS. ADDITIONALLY, WE FULFILL ONLINE ORDERS AT STORES THROUGH OUR BUY ONLINE, SHIP FROM STORE CAPABILITY, MAXIMIZING STORE INVENTORY EXPOSURE TO DIGITAL DEMAND. WE ALSO OFFER RESERVE ONLINE, PICKUP IN STORE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO LOOK UP STORE INVENTORY FROM ALL DIGITAL CHANNELS; AND  \\u2022  SHOPPING BEHAVIOR HAS CONTINUED TO EVOLVE ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS THAT WORK IN TANDEM TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PRESENTING A BRAND LEVEL PERFORMANCE METRIC THAT INCLUDES ALL CHANNELS (I.E., STORES AND AEO DIRECT) IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE, GIVEN CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR AND OUR OMNI-CHANNEL MODEL.  OUR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS COMPARABLE SALES TO BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR CURRENT PERFORMANCE. COMPARABLE SALES RESULTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVE LEVERAGING OF OUR COSTS, INCLUDING STORE PAYROLL, STORE SUPPLIES, RENT, ETC. COMPARABLE SALES ALSO HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE, CASH AND WORKING CAPITAL.  GROSS PROFIT  \\u2014 GROSS PROFIT MEASURES WHETHER WE ARE OPTIMIZING PROFITABILITY OF OUR SALES. GROSS PROFIT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOTAL NET REVENUE AND COST OF SALES. COST OF SALES CONSISTS OF: MERCHANDISE COSTS, INCLUDING DESIGN, SOURCING, IMPORTING AND INBOUND FREIGHT COSTS, AS WELL AS MARKDOWNS, SHRINKAGE AND CERTAIN PROMOTIONAL COSTS (COLLECTIVELY, \\u201cMERCHANDISE COSTS\\u201d) AND BUYING, OCCUPANCY AND WAREHOUSING COSTS. DESIGN COSTS CONSIST OF: COMPENSATION, RENT, DEPRECIATION, TRAVEL, SUPPLIES AND SAMPLES.  BUYING, OCCUPANCY AND WAREHOUSING COSTS CONSIST OF: COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSES AND TRAVEL FOR OUR BUYERS AND CERTAIN SENIOR MERCHANDISING EXECUTIVES; RENT AND UTILITIES RELATED TO OUR STORES, CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND OTHER OFFICE SPACE; FREIGHT FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO THE STORES; COMPENSATION AND SUPPLIES FOR OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, INCLUDING PURCHASING, RECEIVING AND INSPECTION COSTS; AND SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS RELATED TO OUR E-COMMERCE OPERATION.  THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF SALES, INITIAL MARKUPS OR ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR USE OF MARKDOWNS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS PROFIT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OPERATING INCOME  \\u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT VIEWS OPERATING INCOME AS A KEY INDICATOR OF OUR PERFORMANCE. THE KEY DRIVERS OF OPERATING INCOME ARE COMPARABLE SALES, GROSS PROFIT, OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND OUR LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  OMNI-CHANNEL SALES PERFORMANCE  \\u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT UTILIZES THE FOLLOWING QUALITY OF SALES METRICS IN EVALUATING OUR OMNI-CHANNEL SALES PERFORMANCE: COMPARABLE SALES, AVERAGE UNIT RETAIL PRICE (\\u201cAUR\\u201d), UNITS PER TRANSACTION, AVERAGE TRANSACTION VALUE, TRANSACTIONS, CUSTOMER TRAFFIC, CONVERSION RATES, AVERAGE UNIT COST, AND COMPARABLE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS.  INVENTORY TURNOVER  \\u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES INVENTORY TURNOVER AS A MEASURE OF HOW PRODUCTIVELY INVENTORY IS BOUGHT AND SOLD. INVENTORY TURNOVER IS IMPORTANT AS IT CAN SIGNAL SLOW MOVING INVENTORY. THIS CAN BE CRITICAL IN DETERMINING THE NEED TO TAKE MARKDOWNS ON MERCHANDISE.  21  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY  \\u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, INVESTING AND FINANCING IN DETERMINING THE SUFFICIEN  CY OF OUR CASH POSITION.  C  ASH FLOW HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR USES OF CASH. O  UR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT  CASH FLOW WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  OUR SECOND QUARTER PRODUCED RECORD REVENUE AND THE EIGHTEENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF POSITIVE CONSOLIDATED COMPARABLE SALES INCREASES.  HOWEVER, AN UNSEASONABLY COOL MAY SUPPRESSED DEMAND FOR AMERICAN EAGLE SPRING APPAREL, WHICH COMBINED WITH A DELAYED START TO BACK-TO-SCHOOL SHOPPING IN LATE JULY, ADVERSELY IMPACTED SECOND QUARTER SALES AND MARGINS.  DESPITE THE CHALLENGES, WE WERE ENCOURAGED TO SEE MANY AREAS OF THE BUSINESS PERFORM WELL, INCLUDING CONTINUED STRONG MOMENTUM IN AE JEANS, WHICH ACHIEVED RECORD SALES AND AERIE, WHICH POSTED ITS 19  TH  CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF DOUBLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR DIGITAL CHANNEL POSTED A DOUBLE DIGIT SALES INCREASE.  TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED 8% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 TO $1.041 BILLION AND CONSOLIDATED COMPARABLE SALES, INCLUDING AEO DIRECT, INCREASED 2%, FOLLOWING A 9% INCREASE LAST YEAR. BY BRAND, AMERICAN EAGLE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES DECREASED 1% FOLLOWING A 7% INCREASE LAST YEAR. AERIE COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 16% COMPARED TO A 27% INCREASE LAST YEAR.  ADDITIONALLY, INCLUDED IN TOTAL NET REVENUE THIS YEAR WAS $40.0 MILLION RECOGNIZED FOR LICENSE ROYALTIES FROM A THIRD-PARTY OPERATOR OF AE STORES IN JAPAN.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 8% OR $29.5 MILLION TO $382.6 MILLION COMPARED TO $353.1 MILLION LAST YEAR AND IMPROVED 10 BASIS POINTS TO 36.7% AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 8%, OR $19.1 MILLION, TO $253.1 MILLION COMPARED TO $210.2 MILLION LAST YEAR AND REMAINED FLAT AS A RATE TO TOTAL REVENUE OF 24.3%.  NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER INCREASED 8% TO $65.0 MILLION, OR $0.38 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $60.3 MILLION, OR $0.34 PER DILUTED SHARE, LAST YEAR. ON AN ADJUSTED BASIS, NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE THIS QUARTER INCREASED 12% TO $0.39 PER SHARE, WHICH EXCLUDES $0.01 PER SHARE OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES COMPARED TO $0.34 PER DILUTED SHARE LAST YEAR.  DURING THE 26 WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, WE RETURNED $126.9 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES OF $80.0 MILLION AND CASH DIVIDENDS OF $46.9 MILLION.  WE HAD $317.2 MILLION IN CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED TO $363.3 MILLION LAST YEAR.  MERCHANDISE INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER WAS $534.8 MILLION, COMPARED TO $466.1 MILLION LAST YEAR, A 15% INCREASE.  OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY THE PATTERN OF SEASONALITY COMMON TO MOST RETAIL APPAREL BUSINESSES. THE RESULTS FOR THE CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  THIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION CONTAINS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE (\\u201cNON-GAAP\\u201d OR \\u201cADJUSTED\\u201d), ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE, WHICH EXCLUDES NON-GAAP ITEMS. THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE IS NOT BASED ON ANY STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY PRESCRIBED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) AND IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS NON-GAAP INFORMATION IS USEFUL AS AN ADDITIONAL MEANS FOR INVESTORS TO EVALUATE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WHEN REVIEWED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  ASC 820 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED UNDER ASC 820 AS THE EXIT PRICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF AN ASSET OR TRANSFER OF A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE UNDER ASC 820 MUST MAXIMIZE THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZE THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.  IN ADDITION, ASC 820 ESTABLISHES A THREE-TIER FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  THESE TIERS INCLUDE.  \\u2022  LEVEL 1 \\u2014 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.  \\u2022  LEVEL 2 \\u2014 INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.  \\u2022  LEVEL 3 \\u2014 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY LITTLE OR NO MARKET ACTIVITY AND THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, WE HELD CERTAIN ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.  THESE INCLUDE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.  26  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 820, THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS (CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS) MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  .

HISTORICALLY, THESE USES OF CASH HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING CASH ON HAND. ALSO, WE MAINTAIN AN ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO BORROW UP TO $400 MILLION, WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN JANUARY 2024.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR USES OF CASH INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AERIE BRAND, INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND OMNI-CHANNEL CAPABILITIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION EFFORTS.  WE ALSO MADE KEY INVESTMENTS IN THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND OUR ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING STORE PAYROLL AND HIGHER WAGES, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL ADVERTISING EXPENSES. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO FUND OUR FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH CURRENT CASH HOLDINGS AS WELL AS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR GROWTH STRATEGY INCLUDES FORTIFYING OUR BRANDS AND FURTHER E-COMMERCE AND STORE EXPANSION OR ACQUISITIONS. WE PERIODICALLY CONSIDER AND EVALUATE THESE OPTIONS TO SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH. IN THE EVENT WE DO PURSUE SUCH OPTIONS, WE COULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN CLOSING ANY POTENTIAL TRANSACTION, OR THAT ANY ENDEAVOR WE UNDERTAKE WOULD INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY.

OVERVIEW  WE FRANCHISE AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, OPERATE A SYSTEM OF TAX PREPARATION AND RENT-TO-OWN STORES.  THE COMPANY PROVIDES INCOME TAX SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (THE \\\"U.S.\\\") AND CANADA THROUGH ITS LIBERTY TAX SEGMENT AND ITS BUDDY'S SEGMENT LEASES AND SELLS HOUSEHOLD DURABLE GOODS.  OUR LIBERTY TAX SEGMENT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF TAX PREPARATION SERVICES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. IN FISCAL 2019, WE OPERATED 3,108 TAX OFFICES. OUR TAX PREPARATION SERVICES AND RELATED TAX SETTLEMENT PRODUCTS ARE OFFERED PRIMARILY THROUGH FRANCHISED LOCATIONS, ALTHOUGH WE OPERATE A LIMITED NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED OFFICES EACH TAX SEASON. SEE \\\"NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\\" IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, FOR DETAILS OF THE U.S. OFFICE ACTIVITY AND THE NUMBER OF CANADIAN AND COMPANY-OWNED OFFICES FOR THE YEARS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, 2018 AND 2017.  OUR BUDDY'S SEGMENT WAS ACQUIRED ON JULY 10, 2019 AND FRANCHISES OR OPERATES RENT-TO-OWN STORES THAT LEASE HOUSEHOLD DURABLE GOODS, SUCH AS ELECTRONICS, RESIDENTIAL FURNITURE, APPLIANCES AND HOUSEHOLD ACCESSORIES, TO CUSTOMERS ON A RENT-TO-OWN BASIS. MERCHANDISE IS ALSO OFFERED FOR IMMEDIATE PURCHASE OR AN INSTALLMENT SALES BASIS.  ON JUNE 10, 2019, WE OPERATED 291 BUDDY'S STORES PRIMARILY THROUGH FRANCHISED LOCATIONS.  OUR REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM ROYALTIES AND OTHER REQUIRED FEES FROM OUR FRANCHISEES, FINANCIAL PRODUCTS RELATED TO REFUND TRANSFERS, LOANS AND FEES CHARGES TO CUSTOMER IN OUR COMPANY-OWNED LOCATIONS.  ACQUISITION  ON JULY 10, 2019 (THE \\\"BUDDY\\u2019S ACQUISITION DATE\\\"), WE ENTERED INTO AND COMPLETED CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY AN AGREEMENT OF MERGER AND BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT WITH BUDDY'S, FRANCHISE GROUP NEW HOLDCO, LLC, A WHOLLY-OWNED DIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY (\\u201cNEW HOLDCO\\u201d), FRANCHISE GROUP B MERGER SUB, LLC, A WHOLLY-OWNED INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF NEW HOLDCO AND VINTAGE RTO, L.P., SOLELY IN ITS CAPACITY AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FORMER EQUITY HOLDERS OF BUDDY'S (THE \\\"BUDDY'S MEMBERS\\\"), TO ACQUIRE BUDDY'S IN A STOCK TRANSACTION (THE \\\"BUDDY\\u2019S ACQUISITION\\\").  AT THE BUDDY\\u2019S ACQUISITION DATE, EACH OUTSTANDING UNIT OF BUDDY\\u2019S WAS CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE 0.459315 UNITS OF NEW HOLDCO (\\u201cNEW HOLDCO UNITS\\u201d) AND 0.091863 SHARES OF COMPANY VOTING NON-ECONOMIC PREFERRED STOCK (\\\"PREFERRED STOCK\\\").  THE BUDDY'S MEMBERS MAY ELECT, FOLLOWING AN INITIAL SIX-MONTH LOCKUP PERIOD, TO REDEEM ONE NEW HOLDCO UNIT AND ONE-FIFTH OF A SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR ONE SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  AS OF THE BUDDY\\u2019S ACQUISITION DATE, ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS, THE BUDDY'S MEMBERS' AGGREGATE OWNERSHIP OF NEW HOLDCO UNITS AND SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 36.44% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, WHICH IMPLIES AN ENTERPRISE VALUE OF BUDDY'S OF APPROXIMATELY $122 MILLION AND AN EQUITY VALUE OF $12.00 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  WE ARE THE SOLE MANAGING MEMBER OF NEW HOLDCO AND IT WILL BE CONSOLIDATED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.  NEW HOLDCO UNITS HELD BY THE BUDDY'S MEMBERS WILL BE RECORDED AS A NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE AND THE BUDDY'S MEMBERS ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INCOME TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT (THE \\\"TRA\\\"), PURSUANT TO WHICH, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE TRA, WE WILL PAY THE BUDDY'S MEMBERS 40% OF THE CASH SAVINGS, IF ANY, IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES THAT WE REALIZE  OR ARE DEEMED TO REALIZE AS A RESULT OF ANY INCREASES IN TAX BASIS OF THE ASSETS OF NEW HOLDCO RESULTING FROM FUTURE REDEMPTIONS OR EXCHANGES OF NEW HOLDCO UNITS AND PREFERRED STOCK HELD BY THE BUDDY'S MEMBERS IN EXCHANGE FOR COMMON STOCK.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \\u2022  A DECREASE OF $0.9 MILLION IN ASSISTED TAX PREPARATION FEES, NET OF DISCOUNTS RELATED TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED STORES OPERATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR YEAR-ROUND ACCOUNTING OFFICES IN FISCAL 2019; AND  \\u2022  A $0.1 MILLION REDUCTION IN ROYALTIES AND ADVERTISING FEES DUE TO THE TIMING OF ACCRUALS; AND  \\u2022  A DECREASE OF $0.2 MILLION IN FRANCHISEE FEES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASC 606, \\u201c  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  \\u201d (\\u201cASC 606\\u201d) IN FISCAL 2019.  41  OPERATING EXPENSES.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING.  \\u2022  A $8.3 MILLION DECREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR OF RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES RELATED TO COMPANY-STORE EXIT COSTS; AND  \\u2022  A $2.5 MILLION DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED STORES IN FISCAL 2020, THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR YEAR-ROUND ACCOUNTING OFFICES IN FISCAL 2019, EXECUTIVE RECRUITMENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND REDUCTIONS IN OVERALL HEADCOUNT IN FISCAL 2020; AND  \\u2022  A DECREASE OF $0.3 MILLION IN ADVERTISING EXPENSES DUE TO THE TIMING OF SPENDING; AND  \\u2022  A $0.2 MILLION DECREASE IN AREA DEVELOPER EXPENSES DUE TO THE TIMING OF ACCRUALS.  THESE DECREASES WERE SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY.  \\u2022  A $5.8 MILLION INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUDDY\\u2019S ACQUISITION; AND  \\u2022  A $0.6 MILLION INCREASE IN COST OF SALES DUE TO THE BUDDY'S ACQUISITION; AND  \\u2022  A $0.8 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, AND IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE MAINLY DUE TO ASSETS NO LONGER IN SERVICE.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING DISCRETE INCOME TAX ITEMS, WAS  21.1%  AND  32.9%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED TAXES AS A RESULT OF REMEASUREMENT OF TAX RATES IN THE PRIOR YEAR THAT DID NOT RECUR IN FISCAL 2020, THE PERMANENT TAX EFFECT RELATED TO NON-DEDUCTIBLE ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS FOR THE BUDDY\\u2019S ACQUISITION, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW HOLDCO AND THE RELATED NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS. AS NEW HOLDCO IS TREATED AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR TAX PURPOSES, ANY NET INCOME OR LOSS IS PASSED THROUGH ON PRO RATA BASIS TO ITS MEMBERS. THEREFORE, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS ONLY THE ALLOCABLE SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSS OF NEW HOLDCO RELATED TO LIBERTY TAX.  SEGMENT INFORMATION  WE, PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR FRANCHISEES AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORES, OPERATE A SYSTEM OF TAX PREPARATION AND RENT-TO-OWN RETAIL LOCATIONS.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN TWO REPORTING BUSINESS SEGMENTS:  LIBERTY TAX AND BUDDY'S.  WE DEFINE OUR SEGMENTS AS THOSE OPERATIONS WHOSE RESULTS OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (\\\"CODM\\\") REGULARLY REVIEWS TO ANALYZE PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES.  42  THE LIBERTY TAX SEGMENT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF TAX PREPARATION SERVICES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA.  THE LIBERTY TAX SEGMENT INCLUDES OUR OPERATIONS UNDER THE \\\"LIBERTY TAX,\\\" \\\"LIBERTY TAX CANADA\\\" AND \\\"SIEMPRE\\\" BRANDS AND IS HEADQUARTERED IN VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA.  THE BUDDY'S SEGMENT LEASES AND SELLS ELECTRONICS, RESIDENTIAL FURNITURE, APPLIANCES AND HOUSEHOLD ACCESSORIES.  THE BUDDY'S SEGMENT CONSISTS OF OUR OPERATIONS UNDER THE \\\"BUDDY'S\\\" BRAND AND A SEGMENT HEADQUARTER IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA.  WE MEASURE THE RESULTS OF OUR SEGMENTS USING, AMONG OTHER MEASURES, EACH SEGMENT'S NET SALES, OPERATING EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME (LOSS). WE MAY REVISE THE MEASUREMENT OF EACH SEGMENT'S OPERATING INCOME, INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD COSTS, AS DETERMINED BY THE INFORMATION REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM. WHEN THE MEASUREMENT OF A SEGMENT CHANGES, PREVIOUS PERIOD AMOUNTS AND BALANCES ARE RECLASSIFIED TO BE COMPARABLE TO THE CURRENT PERIOD'S PRESENTATION. BECAUSE THE BUDDY'S ACQUISITION OCCURRED IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  , COMPARABLE INFORMATION FOR THE BUDDY'S SEGMENT IS NOT AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, BUDDY'S SEGMENT INFORMATION IS NOT PROVIDED IN THIS DISCUSSION.

ADJUSTED EBITDA.  TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, WE HAVE DISCLOSED IN THE TABLE ABOVE AND WITHIN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ADJUSTED EBITDA. ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS NET INCOME (LOSS), BEFORE INCOME TAXES, INTEREST EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS SPECIFIED BELOW. WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION BELOW OF ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET LOSS, THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  WE HAVE INCLUDED ADJUSTED EBITDA IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT BECAUSE WE SEEK TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS TO ACHIEVE HIGHER LEVELS OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND TO IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE. IN ADDITION, IT IS A KEY BASIS UPON WHICH WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT. WE ALSO USE ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR BUSINESS PLANNING AND THE EVALUATION OF ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES. IN PARTICULAR, THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN EXPENSES IN CALCULATING ADJUSTED EBITDA CAN PROVIDE A USEFUL MEASURE FOR PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA ENHANCES AN OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF AND PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A RECOGNIZED FINANCIAL MEASURE UNDER GAAP AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION FROM OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME (LOSS), OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURES DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

EBITDA IS $20.9 MILLION WITH THESE EXPENSES INCLUDED.  SEASONALITY OF OPERATIONS  GIVEN THE SEASONAL NATURE OF THE TAX RETURN PREPARATION BUSINESS, OUR LIBERTY TAX SEGMENT HAS HISTORICALLY GENERATED AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE MOST OF ITS REVENUES DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1 THROUGH APRIL 30 OF EACH YEAR. FOR  44  EXAMPLE, IN FISCAL  2019  IT EARNED 25% OF OUR ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES DURING THE FISCAL THIRD QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31 AND 89% OF ITS ANNUAL REVENUES DURING THE COMBINED FISCAL THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF  2019  . WE HAVE HISTORICALLY OPERATED AT A LOSS THROUGH THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, DURING WHICH WE INCURRED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PREPARING FOR THE UPCOMING TAX SEASON.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW OF FACTORS AFFECTING OUR LIQUIDITY  SEASONALITY OF CASH FLOW.  OUR TAX RETURN PREPARATION BUSINESS IS SEASONAL, AND MOST OF OUR REVENUES AND CASH FLOW ARE GENERATED DURING THE PERIOD FROM LATE JANUARY THROUGH APRIL 30. FOLLOWING EACH TAX SEASON, FROM MAY 1 THROUGH LATE JANUARY OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR, WE RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON EXCESS OPERATING CASH FLOW FROM THE PREVIOUS SEASON, FROM CASH PAYMENTS MADE BY FRANCHISEES AND ADS WHO PURCHASE NEW TERRITORIES AND AREAS PRIOR TO THE NEXT TAX SEASON, AND ON THE USE OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND INVEST IN THE FUTURE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. OUR BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY GENERATED A STRONG CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.  WE DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CASH RESOURCES DURING THE OFF SEASON TO FINANCE THE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR FRANCHISEES, AND EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE.  BUDDY'S TERM LOAN.  ON JULY 10, 2019, AS PART OF THE BUDDY'S ACQUISITION, OUR BUDDY\\u2019S SEGMENT ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cBUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN\\u201d) WITH VARIOUS LENDERS (THE \\u201cBUDDY\\u2019S LENDERS\\u201d) AND KAYNE SOLUTIONS FUND, L.P., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND AS COLLATERAL AGENT (\\u201cBUDDY\\u2019S AGENT\\u201d). THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN PROVIDES FOR AN $82.0 MILLION FIRST PRIORITY SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN TO BE MADE BY THE BUDDY\\u2019S LENDERS TO THE BUDDY\\u2019S BORROWERS. OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN ARE GUARANTEED BY OUR BUDDY'S SEGMENT AND ARE REQUIRED TO BE GUARANTEED BY EACH OF BUDDY\\u2019S DIRECT AND INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES THAT MAY BE FORMED AFTER THE DATE HEREOF. THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN ARE SECURED ON A FIRST PRIORITY BASIS BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF OUR BUDDY\\u2019S SEGMENT. A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN WAS USED TO PREPAY AND TERMINATE THE OUTSTANDING REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OF BUDDY\\u2019S AND CERTAIN OTHER PERSONS WITH TEXAS CAPITAL BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION.  THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN WILL MATURE ON JULY 10, 2024. THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN WILL, AT OUR OPTION, BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER (I) A RATE PER ANNUM BASED ON LIBOR FOR AN INTEREST PERIOD OF ONE, TWO, THREE OR SIX MONTHS, PLUS AN INTEREST RATE MARGIN OF 8.0% (A \\u201cLIBOR LOAN\\u201d) WITH A 1.50% LIBOR FLOOR, OR (II) AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE DETERMINED AS PROVIDED IN THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN, PLUS AN INTEREST RATE MARGIN OF 7.0% (AN \\u201cABR LOAN\\u201d) WITH A 2.50% ALTERNATE BASE RATE FLOOR. INTEREST ON LIBOR LOANS IS PAYABLE IN ARREARS AT THE END OF EACH APPLICABLE INTEREST PERIOD (AND, WITH RESPECT TO A SIX-MONTH INTEREST PERIOD, THREE MONTHS AFTER COMMENCEMENT OF THE INTEREST PERIOD), AND INTEREST ON ABR LOANS IS PAYABLE IN ARREARS ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER. IF THE CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO OF OUR BUDDY'S SEGMENT EXCEEDS CERTAIN THRESHOLDS SET FORTH IN THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN, THE BUDDY\\u2019S BORROWERS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL 2.0% INTEREST ON THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN, TO BE PAID-IN-KIND.  THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN IS REQUIRED TO BE REPAID IN EQUAL QUARTERLY INSTALLMENTS OF $1,025,000 ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER, COMMENCING ON OCTOBER 1, 2019. THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN ALSO REQUIRES PREPAYMENT WITH 75% OF CONSOLIDATED EXCESS CASH FLOW ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WITH THE NET CASH PROCEEDS OF CERTAIN OTHER CUSTOMARY EVENTS. ALL VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS AND CERTAIN CUSTOMARY MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN ARE SUBJECT TO A PREPAYMENT PENALTY. PRIOR TO THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, THE PREPAYMENT PENALTY IS A MAKE-WHOLE PREMIUM ON THE PORTION OF THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN SO PREPAID. THEREAFTER, THE AMOUNT OF THE PREPAYMENT PENALTY ON THE PORTION OF THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN SO PREPAID IS (A) 3.0%, FROM THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE THROUGH (BUT NOT INCLUDING) THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, (B) 2.0%, FROM THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE THROUGH (BUT NOT INCLUDING) THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, AND (C) 1.0%, FROM THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE THROUGH (BUT NOT INCLUDING) THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PAY LIBOR BREAKAGE AND REDEPLOYMENT COSTS IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE BUDDY\\u2019S CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES CUSTOMARY AFFIRMATIVE, NEGATIVE, AND FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER REPORTS. THE NEGATIVE COVENANTS LIMIT OUR ABILITY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INCUR DEBT, INCUR LIENS, MAKE INVESTMENTS, SELL ASSETS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS CAPITAL STOCK AND ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS SET FORTH IN THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN INCLUDE A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO AND A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, IN EACH CASE WITH RESPECT TO BUDDY\\u2019S AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, TO BE TESTED AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER (OTHER THAN, WITH RESPECT TO THE MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2019), AND A REQUIREMENT THAT THE MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY OF BUDDY\\u2019S AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES MUST NOT BE LESS THAN $1.0 MILLION AT ANY TIME. IN ADDITION, THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN INCLUDES CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN OF WHICH MAY REQUIRE THAT THE PAYMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL 2.0% INTEREST ON THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN TO BE PAID IN-KIND. THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS OF THE BUDDY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF  JULY 31, 2019.  45  LIBERTY TAX CREDIT FACILITY.  ON MAY 16, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\\"CREDIT AGREEMENT\\\") WHICH PROVIDES FOR A $135.0 MILLION SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\\"REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\\\"), A $10.0 MILLION SUB-FACILITY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, AND A $20.0 MILLION SWINGLINE LOAN SUBFACILITY. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL MATURE ON MAY 31, 2020. BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL, AT OUR OPTION, BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER (I) A LIBOR LOAN, OR (II) AN ABR LOAN. THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN VARIES FROM 3.0% PER ANNUM TO 4.0% PER ANNUM FOR LIBOR LOANS, AND FROM 2.0% PER ANNUM TO 3.0% PER ANNUM FOR ABR LOANS, IN EACH CASE DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO, AND IS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH A PRICING GRID IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\\"PRICING GRID\\\"). INTEREST ON LIBOR LOANS IS PAYABLE IN ARREARS AT THE END OF EACH APPLICABLE INTEREST PERIOD, AND INTEREST ON ABR LOANS IS PAYABLE IN ARREARS AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR QUARTER. WE HAVE AGREED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO PAY A FEE ON THE AVERAGE DAILY UNUSED AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING THE TERM. THE UNUSED FEE IS PAYABLE IN ARREARS AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR QUARTER AND ACCRUES AT A RATE WHICH VARIES FROM 0.25% TO 0.5% DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRICING GRID. WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO PAY (1) A FEE FOR EACH OUTSTANDING LETTER OF CREDIT AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRICING GRID, MULTIPLIED BY THE AVERAGE DAILY AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO BE DRAWN UNDER SUCH LETTER OF CREDIT, AND (2) A FRONTING FEE WHICH SHALL ACCRUE AT A RATE OF 0.125% PER ANNUM ON THE AVERAGE DAILY AMOUNT OF THE OUTSTANDING AGGREGATE LETTER-OF-CREDIT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE GUARANTEED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF EACH OF OUR DIRECT AND INDIRECT DOMESTIC WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. THERE ARE NO PREPAYMENT PENALTIES IN THE EVENT WE ELECT TO PREPAY AND TERMINATE THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PRIOR TO ITS SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE, SUBJECT TO LIBOR BREAKAGE AND REDEPLOYMENT COSTS IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES CUSTOMARY AFFIRMATIVE, NEGATIVE, AND FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER REPORTS AND MAINTENANCE OF EXISTENCE. THE NEGATIVE COVENANTS LIMIT OUR ABILITY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO INCUR DEBT, INCUR LIENS, MAKE INVESTMENTS, SELL ASSETS AND PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR CAPITAL STOCK. THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDE A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO AND A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, EACH OF WHICH WILL BE TESTED AT THE END OF OUR FISCAL QUARTERS, AND A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH RATIO TESTED AT THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, FOR A PERIOD OF 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS AFTER MAY 16, 2019, OUR OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $12.5 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, FROM APRIL 30, 2020 UNTIL THE MATURITY DATE, OUR OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS MUST BE REDUCED TO $0. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR FINANCIAL COVENANTS AS OF  JULY 31, 2019.  OUR PREVIOUS CREDIT FACILITY CONSISTED OF A $21.2 MILLION TERM LOAN AND A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWED BORROWING OF UP TO $170.0 MILLION, AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, WITH AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT PERMITTED US TO REQUEST AN INCREASE IN AVAILABILITY OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $50.0 MILLION. OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ACCRUED INTEREST, WHICH WAS PAID MONTHLY, AT A RATE OF THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A MARGIN RANGING FROM 1.50% TO 2.25% DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. AT APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE INTEREST RATE WAS 4.25% AND 3.64%, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE PAID DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS 3.97%. A COMMITMENT FEE THAT VARIED FROM 0.25% TO 0.50% DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS PAID MONTHLY. THE INDEBTEDNESS WAS COLLATERALIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY AND BOTH LOANS MATURED ON APRIL 30, 2019 (EXCEPT AS TO THE COMMITMENTS OF ONE LENDER UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH MATURED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2017). ON MAY 1, 2019, WE REPAID THE $12.0 MILLION BALANCE UNDER THE TERM LOAN OF OUR PREVIOUS CREDIT FACILITY USING CASH ON HAND.  SUBORDINATED NOTE  . ON MAY 16, 2019, WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A SUBORDINATED NOTE (THE \\\"SUBORDINATED NOTE\\\") PAYABLE TO VINTAGE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC (\\u201cVINTAGE\\u201d). THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ALL LOANS TO BE MADE BY VINTAGE UNDER THE SUBORDINATED NOTE SHALL NOT EXCEED $10.0 MILLION. ANY INDEBTEDNESS OWED TO VINTAGE UNDER THE SUBORDINATED NOTE IS SUBORDINATE TO AND SUBJECT IN RIGHT AND TIME OF PAYMENT TO THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE SUBORDINATED NOTE AT THIS TIME. THE SUBORDINATED NOTE WILL MATURE ON AUGUST 31, 2020. INTEREST WILL ACCRUE ON THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SUBORDINATED NOTE OUTSTANDING FROM TIME TO TIME AT A RATE PER ANNUM BASED ON LIBOR FOR AN INTEREST PERIOD OF ONE MONTH, PLUS 4.0%. WE ALSO AGREED IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTE TO PAY VINTAGE A COMMITMENT FEE, AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO 0.50%, ON THE AVERAGE DAILY AMOUNT IN EACH MONTH BY WHICH THE STATED AMOUNT OF THE SUBORDINATED NOTE EXCEEDS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF LOANS MADE THEREUNDER AND NOT REPAID. SUCH ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEE ARE PAYABLE IN KIND (RATHER THAN IN CASH OR OTHER CONSIDERATION), QUARTERLY IN ARREARS, BY BEING ADDED TO THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE SUBORDINATED NOTE, WITH SUCH AMOUNTS BEARING INTEREST THEREAFTER IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SUBORDINATED NOTE.  FRANCHISEE LENDING AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS.  A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW DURING THE YEAR IS UTILIZED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO OUR FRANCHISEES. AT  JULY 31, 2019  , OUR TOTAL BALANCE OF LOANS TO FRANCHISEES AND ADS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT LOANS, REPRESENTING CASH AMOUNTS WE HAD ADVANCED TO THE FRANCHISEES AND ADS, WAS $12.6 MILLION. IN ADDITION, AT THAT DATE, OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS TOGETHER OWED US AN ADDITIONAL $56.4 MILLION, NET OF UNRECOGNIZED REVENUE OF  46  $6.1 MILLION, FOR AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE UNPAID PURCHASE PRICE FOR FRANCHISE TERRITORIES OR AREAS COMPRISING CLUSTERS OF TERRITORIES AND OTHER AMOUNTS OWED TO US FOR ROYALTIES AND OTHER AMOUNTS FOR WHICH OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS HAD OUTSTANDING PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A BREAKDOWN OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS.  (IN MILLIONS)  AT JULY 31, 2019  LOANS TO FRANCHISEES AND ADS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT LOANS  $12.6  UNPAID PURCHASE PRICE OF FRANCHISE TERRITORIES, ROYALTIES AND OTHER AMOUNTS, GROSS  62.5  UNRECOGNIZED REVENUE  (6.1  )  UNPAID PURCHASE PRICE OF FRANCHISE TERRITORIES, ROYALTIES AND OTHER AMOUNTS, NET  56.4  BOOK BALANCE OF AMOUNTS DUE  69.0  AD SHARE OF ROYALTIES AND FRANCHISE FEES  (5.8  )  EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS  $63.2  OUR FRANCHISEES MAKE ELECTRONIC RETURN FILINGS FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS UTILIZING OUR SYSTEMS. OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS ALLOW US TO OBTAIN REPAYMENT OF AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM OUR FRANCHISEES THROUGH AN ELECTRONIC FEE INTERCEPT PROGRAM BEFORE OUR FRANCHISEES RECEIVE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM TAX PREPARATION AND OTHER FEES THEY HAVE CHARGED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS ON TAX RETURNS ASSOCIATED WITH TAX SETTLEMENT PRODUCTS. THEREFORE, WE ARE ABLE TO MINIMIZE THE NONPAYMENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING FROM FRANCHISEES BY OBTAINING DIRECT ELECTRONIC PAYMENT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE THROUGHOUT THE TAX SEASON. OUR CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING TO ADS IS ALSO MITIGATED BY OUR ELECTRONIC FEE INTERCEPT PROGRAM, WHICH ENABLES US TO RETAIN REPAYMENTS OF AMOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE FLOW THROUGH TO ADS AS THEIR SHARE OF FRANCHISE FEE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS, TO THE EXTENT OF AN AD'S INDEBTEDNESS TO US.  THE UNPAID AMOUNTS OWED TO US FROM OUR ADS AND FRANCHISEES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING FRANCHISE OR AREA AND, WHEN THE FRANCHISE OR AREA OWNER IS AN ENTITY, ARE GENERALLY GUARANTEED BY THE RELATED OWNERS OF THE RESPECTIVE ENTITY. ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT A FRANCHISEE OR AD DOES NOT SATISFY ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US, WE MAY REPOSSESS THE UNDERLYING FRANCHISE OR AREA IN ORDER TO RESELL IT IN THE FUTURE. AT  JULY 31, 2019  , WE HAD AN INVESTMENT IN IMPAIRED ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND RELATED INTEREST RECEIVABLE OF APPROXIMATELY  $16.7 MILLION  . WE CONSIDER ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE TO BE IMPAIRED IF THE AMOUNTS DUE EXCEED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING FRANCHISE AND ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED ON THAT EXCESS. AMOUNTS DUE INCLUDE THE RECORDED VALUE OF THE ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE REDUCED BY THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTED INTEREST, AMOUNTS DUE TO ADS FOR THEIR PORTION OF FRANCHISEE RECEIVABLES, ANY RELATED UNRECOGNIZED REVENUE AND AMOUNTS OWED TO THE FRANCHISEE OR AD BY US. IN ESTABLISHING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING FRANCHISE, WE CONSIDER NET FEES OF OPEN TERRITORIES AND THE NUMBER OF UNOPENED TERRITORIES. AT  JULY 31, 2019  , WE HAVE RECORDED AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR IMPAIRED ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OF  $8.2 MILLION  . THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISEE OR AD AS OF  JULY 31, 2019  .  WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AS OF  JULY 31, 2019  IS ADEQUATE FOR OUR EXISTING LOSS EXPOSURE. WE CLOSELY MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS AND WILL ADJUST OUR ALLOWANCES AS APPROPRIATE IF WE DETERMINE THE EXISTING ALLOWANCES ARE INADEQUATE TO COVER ESTIMATED LOSSES.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF SECURITIES  .  ON JULY 10, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT WITH TRIBUTUM (THE \\u201cCLOSING SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT\\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH TRIBUTUM PURCHASED FROM THE COMPANY 2,083,333.33 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF $12.00 PER SHARE FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $25,000,000 IN CASH. ALSO, ON JULY 10, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT WITH TRIBUTUM (THE \\u201cPOST-CLOSING SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT\\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH TRIBUTUM COMMITTED TO PURCHASE FROM THE COMPANY ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF $12.00 PER SHARE. THE NUMBER OF SHARES PURCHASED PURSUANT TO THE POST-CLOSING SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TENDERED IN THE TENDER OFFER (AMONG OTHER FACTORS), AND SUCH AMOUNT WILL BE EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK NECESSARY FOR THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY TO BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE THE TENDER OFFER AFTER APPLYING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE CLOSING SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN. THE PURCHASE PRICE UNDER THE POST CLOSING SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED $40 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE.  TENDER OFFER.  ON JULY 10, 2019, AS PART OF THE BUDDY'S ACQUISITION, WE AGREED TO COMMENCE A TENDER OFFER (THE \\\"TENDER OFFER\\\") ON JULY 25, 2019 TO PURCHASE ANY AND ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR CASH AT A PRICE OF $12.00 PER SHARE, WITHOUT INTEREST. THE TENDER OFFER WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM TENDER REQUIREMENT, AND, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW, CERTAIN OF OUR LARGE STOCKHOLDERS HAVE AGREED NOT TO TENDER THEIR SHARES IN THE TENDER OFFER. THE TENDER OFFER WILL BE FINANCED THROUGH CASH ON HAND, THE PROCEEDS FROM THE CLOSING SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT, THE PROCEEDS OF THE BUDDY\\u2019S TERM LOAN AND IF NECESSARY A SECOND SUBSCRIPTION BY TRIBUTUM FOR ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $12.00 PER SHARE PURSUANT TO THE POST-CLOSING SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT, SUCH THAT THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WILL ENABLE US TO COMPLETE THE TENDER OFFER.  47  DIVIDENDS  .   BEGINNING IN APRIL 2015 THROUGH JULY 2018, WE ANNOUNCED A $0.16 PER SHARE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND. WE HAVE NOT DECLARED A DIVIDEND SINCE JULY 2018 AND MAY NOT CONTINUE TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON OUR EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND MAY BE RESTRICTED BY ANY FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS THAT WE INCUR OR ISSUANCES OF PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DETERMINE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SURPLUS PRIOR TO THE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE AN ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PAY DIVIDENDS AT ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL OR AT ALL.  TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT.  WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE TRA PAYMENTS TO THE BUDDY\\u2019S MEMBERS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TRA, WE WILL PAY THE BUDDY'S MEMBERS 40% OF THE CASH SAVINGS, IF ANY, IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES THAT WE REALIZE OR ARE DEEMED TO REALIZE AS A RESULT OF ANY INCREASES IN TAX BASIS OF THE ASSETS OF NEW HOLDCO RESULTING FROM FUTURE REDEMPTIONS OR EXCHANGES OF NEW HOLDCO UNITS HELD BY THE BUDDY'S MEMBERS. ANY FUTURE OBLIGATIONS AND THE TIMING OF SUCH PAYMENTS UNDER THE TRA, HOWEVER, ARE SUBJECT TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING (I) THE TIMING OF SUBSEQUENT EXCHANGES OF NEW HOLDCO UNITS BY THE BUDDY\\u2019S MEMBERS, (II) THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF EXCHANGE, (III) THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH EXCHANGES ARE TAXABLE, (IV) THE ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME OVER THE TERM OF THE TRA TO REALIZE THE TAX BENEFITS AND (V) ANY FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS. IF WE DO NOT GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME IN THE AGGREGATE OVER THE TERM OF THE TRA TO UTILIZE THE TAX BENEFITS, THEN WE WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THE RELATED TRA PAYMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL POTENTIAL TRA PAYMENTS. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF THE TRA PAYMENTS WOULD REDUCE THE TOTAL CASH FLOW TO US AND NEW HOLDCO, WE EXPECT THE CASH TAX SAVINGS WE WILL REALIZE FROM THE UTILIZATION OF THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. THEREFORE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE TRA PAYMENTS WOULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  , WE USED  $3.6 MILLION  LESS CASH IN OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $2.5 MILLION REDUCTION IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PAYMENTS IN FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  , WE UTILIZED  $0.8 MILLION  LESS CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  . THIS DECREASE IS LARGELY DUE TO A $1.0 MILLION REDUCTION IN NET CASH USED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF OPERATING LOANS TO FRANCHISEES AND ADS, NET OF REPAYMENTS, $0.4 MILLION LESS IN PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $0.6 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED TO BUYBACK FRANCHISEES AND AREA DEVELOPERS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  , CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED  $75.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A $25.0 MILLION INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK ISSUANCES, A $82.0 MILLION INCREASE IN NET BORROWINGS UNDER OUR BUDDY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND A $7.3 MILLION INCREASE IN NET BORROWINGS UNDER THE LIBERTY CREDIT AGREEMENT, OFFSET BY A $39.3 MILLION INCREASE IN REPAYMENTS OF DEBT AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.  FUTURE CASH NEEDS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  OPERATING CASH FLOW NEEDS.  WE BELIEVE OUR CREDIT FACILITY ENTERED INTO ON MAY 16, 2019, AS AMENDED, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR CASH FLOW NEEDS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  AT  JULY 31, 2019  , USING THE LEVERAGE RATIO APPLICABLE UNDER OUR LOAN COVENANTS AT THE END OF THE QUARTER, OUR MAXIMUM UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY WAS  $112.2 MILLION.  OUR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS A REQUIREMENT THAT WE REDUCE THE BALANCE OF OUR REVOLVING LOAN TO ZERO BY APRIL 30, 2020 UNTIL THE MATURITY DATE OF THE AGREEMENT ON MAY 31, 2020; HOWEVER, GIVEN OUR HISTORIC CASH FLOW EXPERIENCE AT THE END OF AND BEGINNING OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OUR REVOLVING LOAN DURING THIS PERIOD WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW.  WE HAVE $55.1 MILLION OF CASH AVAILABLE FROM THE BUDDY'S CREDIT AGREEMENT AFTER REPAYMENT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY ASSUMED IN THE BUDDY'S ACQUISITION. WE EXPECT THESE FUNDS WILL BE USED IN THE TENDER OFFER OR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITIONS.  SEVERAL FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW IN FUTURE PERIODS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \\u2022  THE DELAY BY THE IRS TO ISSUE REFUNDS TO TAXPAYERS WHO CLAIM THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OR THE CHILD TAX CREDIT;  48  \\u2022  THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE EXTEND OPERATING FINANCING TO OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS AND THE EXTENT THAT OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS REPAY THEIR NOTES TO US;  \\u2022  THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF FUTURE ACQUISITIONS;  \\u2022  THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES;  \\u2022  THE CASH FLOW EFFECT OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES REPURCHASED UNDER THE TENDER OFFER;  \\u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE FEES AND OTHER INCOME RELATED TO TAX SETTLEMENT PRODUCTS IN LIGHT OF REGULATORY PRESSURES ON US AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS;  \\u2022  THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REPURCHASE AD AREAS, WHICH WILL INVOLVE THE USE OF CASH IN THE SHORT-TERM, BUT IMPROVE CASH RECEIPTS IN FUTURE PERIODS FROM WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE AD'S SHARE OF ROYALTIES AND FRANCHISE FEES;  \\u2022  THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REPURCHASE CERTAIN ASSETS FROM FRANCHISEES AND THIRD PARTIES AND OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE THESE ASSETS PROFITABLY;  \\u2022  THE EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ELECTS TO CONTINUE TO DECLARE CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK;  \\u2022  THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS; AND  \\u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO A NEW CREDIT FACILITY PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF OUR CURRENT FACILITY ON MAY 31, 2020.  EFFECT OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY COVENANTS ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WAS ENTERED INTO ON MAY 16, 2019, IMPOSES SEVERAL RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING A COVENANT THAT REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A \\\"LEVERAGE RATIO\\\" OF NOT MORE THAN 5.25:1 AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER ENDING JANUARY 31 AND A RATIO OF NOT MORE THAN 3.0:1 AT THE END OF EACH OTHER FISCAL QUARTER. THE HIGHER PERMITTED LEVERAGE RATIO AT THE END OF THE JANUARY 31 QUARTER REFLECTS THE FACT THAT AS OF THAT DATE, WE HAVE TYPICALLY EXTENDED SIGNIFICANT CREDIT TO OUR FRANCHISEES FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER NEEDS THAT IS NOT REFLECTED IN REVENUE THAT WE RECEIVE FROM OUR FRANCHISEES UNTIL THE PERIOD BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY EACH YEAR.  AT  JULY 31, 2019  , OUR LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 0.9:1.  WE CONTINUE TO BE OBLIGATED UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO SATISFY A FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO TEST WHICH REQUIRES THAT RATIO TO BE NOT LESS THAN 1.5:1 AT THE END OF EVERY FISCAL QUARTER. AT  JULY 31, 2019  OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WAS 2.2:1.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RATIO TESTS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION AS OF  JULY 31, 2019  . WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR CASH FLOW AND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE ARE A PARTY TO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS US TO MANAGE FLUCTUATIONS IN CASH FLOW RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE ON OUR VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGE. THIS SWAP EFFECTIVELY CHANGES THE VARIABLE-RATE OF OUR MORTGAGE INTO A FIXED RATE OF 4.12%. AT  JULY 31, 2019  , THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP WAS A LIABILITY OF LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION AND WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES.

SEE \\u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\\u201d  OVERVIEW  EXPRESS IS A LEADING FASHION BRAND FOR WOMEN AND MEN. SINCE 1980, EXPRESS HAS PROVIDED THE LATEST APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES TO HELP CUSTOMERS BUILD A WARDROBE FOR EVERY OCCASION, OFFERING FASHION AND QUALITY AT AN ATTRACTIVE VALUE. THE COMPANY OPERATES MORE THAN  600  RETAIL AND FACTORY OUTLET STORES IN THE UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO, AS WELL AS AN ONLINE DESTINATION.  Q2 2019 VS. Q2 2018  \\u2022  NET SALES DECREASED 4.2% TO $472.7 MILLION  \\u2022  COMPARABLE SALES DECREASED 6%  \\u2022  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES (INCLUDES BOTH RETAIL STORES AND E-COMMERCE SALES) DECREASED 7%  \\u2022  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES DECREASED 2%  \\u2022  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED 160 BASIS POINTS TO 26.8%  \\u2022  OPERATING (LOSS)/INCOME DECREASED $12.4 MILLION TO A LOSS OF $9.8 MILLION  \\u2022  NET (LOSS)/INCOME DECREASED $11.9 MILLION TO A LOSS OF $9.7 MILLION  \\u2022  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) DECREASED $0.17 TO A LOSS OF $(0.14)  THE FOLLOWING CHARTS SHOW KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CEO TRANSITION  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 22, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THAT DAVID KORNBERG WOULD NO LONGER SERVE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRESIDENT OR AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD. ON THE SAME DATE, THE BOARD APPOINTED MATTHEW MOELLERING AS INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND INTERIM PRESIDENT UNTIL A PERMANENT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT IS APPOINTED. ON MAY 21, 2019, THE BOARD APPOINTED TIMOTHY BAXTER TO SERVE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY, EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 17, 2019.  FOLLOWING MR. BAXTER\\u2019S APPOINTMENT, MR. MOELLERING HAS CONTINUED TO SERVE AS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER.  OUTLOOK & SECOND QUARTER UPDATE  AS WE MOVE FORWARD, WE WILL BE FOCUSED ON FOUR FOUNDATIONAL PRIORITIES: PRODUCT, BRAND, CUSTOMER AND EXECUTION. WHILE WE EXPECT OUR RESULTS TO REMAIN CHALLENGING IN THE NEAR-TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT BY FOCUSING ON THESE FOUNDATIONAL PRIORITIES WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE TREND OF THE BUSINESS AND RETURN THE BUSINESS TO LONG TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING DEFINES EACH AREA AND PROVIDES AN UPDATE ON EACH PRIORITY FOR THE SECOND QUARTER.  PRODUCT  EXPRESS WAS ONCE SEEN AS A FASHION AUTHORITY AND A TRUSTED RESOURCE TO HELP CUSTOMERS BUILD THEIR WARDROBE. WE\\u2019VE LOST SOME OF THAT CREDIBILITY DUE TO PRODUCT MISSES. WHILE THERE ARE AREAS OF STRENGTH IN OUR WOMEN\\u2019S AND MEN\\u2019S ASSORTMENT, WE NEED TO BE WINNING IN KEY CATEGORIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND TAKEN ACTION IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS DURING THE QUARTER.  \\u2022  WOMEN\\u2019S TOP  S. WE\\u2019VE HAD TOO MUCH DEPTH IN OLDER KEY ITEMS AND NOT ENOUGH BREADTH AND STYLE DIVERSITY. WE ARE CONDUCTING TESTS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF OPTIMIZING OUR TOPS ASSORTMENT BY ADDING DIFFERENT COLORS, FABRICS, PRINTS AND SILHOUETTES AND WILL APPLY THESE LEARNINGS GOING FORWARD.  \\u2022  SPEED TO MARKET.  IN ORDER TO MOVE FASTER AND GET MORE NEWNESS IN OUR ASSORTMENT, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NEW INSTABUY PROCESS FOR BOTH WOMEN\\u2019S AND MEN\\u2019S. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF OUR ASSORTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO BE CREATED BY OUR INTERNAL DESIGN TEAM, WE ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO INSTANTLY BUY PRODUCT FROM OUR VENDORS THAT COMPLETE OR ENHANCE THE ASSORTMENT.  \\u2022  PRODUCT CATEGORIZATION.  WE ARE RETHINKING THE BRAND\\u2019S TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO CATEGORIZING OUR PRODUCT INTO FOUR LIFESTYLES BASED ON WEARING OCCASIONS. OUR FLOORSETS NOW REFLECT A MORE MODERN APPROACH AND PROVIDE MORE INSPIRATION FOR THE CUSTOMER AS THEY BUILD THEIR WARDROBE.  BRAND  WE PLAN TO CLARIFY OUR BRAND MESSAGE AND MORE CLOSELY CONNECT IT TO OUR PRODUCT STRATEGY TO TELL OUR STORY IN A MORE POWERFUL AND CONSISTENT WAY. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, WE BEGAN THIS WORK AROUND THE ARTICULATION OF OUR BRAND AS WELL AS HOW WE COMMUNICATE IN ORDER TO HELP CUSTOMERS UNDERSTAND THE ROLE EXPRESS PLAYS IN THEIR LIFE.  CUSTOMER  WE NEED TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW ONES. DURING THE QUARTER, WE IMPLEMENTED TWO NEW TOOLS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR MARKETING SPEND ON BOTH RETENTION AND ACQUISITION OF CUSTOMERS. WE ARE USING A MARKETING MIX MODEL TOOL TO ASSESS WHERE WE ARE SPENDING OUR MARKETING DOLLARS AND WHICH CHANNELS DELIVER THE BEST RETURN ON  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENT AND WE ARE ALSO USING MULTI-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION TOOL TO EVALUATE THE REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE OF OUR IN-MARKET MESSAGES AND TRACK THE CUSTOMER\\u2019S JOURNEY TO PURCHASE, BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE. IN ADDITION, IN MAY, WE LAUNCHED A NEW FIRST IMPRESSIONS STRATEGY TO ENCOURAGE REPEAT PURCHASES WITHIN THE FIRST 90 DAYS OF INITIAL PURCHASE.  EXECUTION  WE NEED TO DELIVER A BETTER AND MORE CONSISTENT EXPERIENCE ACROSS CHANNELS, AND WE MUST REDUCE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES AND RIGHT SIZING OUR EXPENSES. WE ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES BY REDUCING TIME ON NON-SELLING ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVING CONVERSION AND OTHER METRICS THROUGH IMPROVED MERCHANDISE FLOW AND A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS  IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE CONSIDER A VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL MEASURES. THESE KEY MEASURES INCLUDE NET SALES, COMPARABLE SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, GROSS PROFIT/GROSS MARGIN, AND SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE DESCRIBES AND DISCUSSES THESE MEASURES.  FINANCIAL MEASURES  DESCRIPTION  DISCUSSION  NET SALES  REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF MERCHANDISE, LESS RETURNS AND DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS SHIPPING AND HANDLING REVENUE RELATED TO E-COMMERCE, REVENUE FROM THE RENTAL OF OUR LED SIGN IN TIMES SQUARE, GIFT CARD BREAKAGE, REVENUE EARNED FROM OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT, AND REVENUE EARNED FROM OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL, AND WE HAVE HISTORICALLY REALIZED A HIGHER PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON. GENERALLY, APPROXIMATELY 45% OF OUR ANNUAL NET SALES OCCUR IN THE SPRING SEASON (FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS) AND 55% OCCUR IN THE FALL SEASON (THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS).  COMPARABLE SALES  COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE OF THE AMOUNT OF SALES GENERATED IN A PERIOD RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES GENERATED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WERE CALCULATED USING THE 13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE 13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES INCLUDES.  \\u2022      SALES FROM RETAIL STORES THAT WERE OPEN 12 MONTHS OR MORE AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD  \\u2022      E-COMMERCE SALES  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES INCLUDES.  \\u2022      SALES FROM OUTLET STORES THAT WERE OPEN 12 MONTHS OR MORE AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD, INCLUDING CONVERSIONS  COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES.  \\u2022      SALES FROM STORES WHERE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE HAS CHANGED BY MORE THAN 20% DUE TO REMODEL OR RELOCATION ACTIVITY  \\u2022      SALES FROM STORES IN A PHASED REMODEL WHERE A PORTION OF THE STORE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THEREFORE NOT PRODUCTIVE SELLING SPACE  \\u2022      SALES FROM STORES WHERE THE STORE CANNOT OPEN DUE TO WEATHER DAMAGE OR OTHER CATASTROPHE  OUR BUSINESS AND OUR COMPARABLE SALES ARE SUBJECT, AT CERTAIN TIMES, TO CALENDAR SHIFTS, WHICH MAY OCCUR DURING KEY SELLING PERIODS CLOSE TO HOLIDAYS SUCH AS EASTER, THANKSGIVING, AND CHRISTMAS, AND REGIONAL FLUCTUATIONS FOR EVENTS SUCH AS SALES TAX HOLIDAYS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL MEASURES  DESCRIPTION  DISCUSSION  COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.  \\u2022  DIRECT COST OF PURCHASED MERCHANDISE  \\u2022  INVENTORY SHRINK AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS  \\u2022  INBOUND AND OUTBOUND FREIGHT  \\u2022  MERCHANDISING, DESIGN, PLANNING AND ALLOCATION, AND MANUFACTURING/PRODUCTION COSTS  \\u2022  OCCUPANCY COSTS RELATED TO STORE OPERATIONS (SUCH AS RENT AND COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, UTILITIES, AND DEPRECIATION ON ASSETS)  \\u2022  LOGISTICS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD TYPICALLY INCREASES IN HIGHER VOLUME QUARTERS BECAUSE THE DIRECT COST OF PURCHASED MERCHANDISE IS TIED TO SALES.  THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE COSTS OF INDIVIDUAL GOODS ARE RAW MATERIALS, LABOR IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MERCHANDISE IS SOURCED, AND LOGISTICS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTING OUR MERCHANDISE.  BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS RELATED TO STORES ARE LARGELY FIXED AND DO NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE AS VOLUME INCREASES.  CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY TYPE OF PRODUCT OR BY CHANNEL MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR OVERALL COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  GROSS PROFIT/GROSS MARGIN  GROSS PROFIT IS NET SALES MINUS COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS. GROSS MARGIN MEASURES GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  GROSS PROFIT/GROSS MARGIN IS IMPACTED BY THE PRICE AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO SELL OUR MERCHANDISE AND THE COST OF OUR PRODUCT.  WE REVIEW OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ON AN ON-GOING BASIS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY SLOW-MOVING MERCHANDISE AND GENERALLY USE MARKDOWNS TO CLEAR SUCH MERCHANDISE. THE TIMING AND LEVEL OF MARKDOWNS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SEASONALITY AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR MERCHANDISE AND HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.  ANY MARKED DOWN MERCHANDISE THAT IS NOT SOLD IS MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK. WE USE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS TO DISPOSE OF THIS MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK MERCHANDISE.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCLUDES OPERATING COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS SUCH AS.  \\u2022  PAYROLL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO OPERATIONS AT OUR CORPORATE OFFICES  \\u2022  STORE EXPENSES OTHER THAN OCCUPANCY COSTS  \\u2022  MARKETING EXPENSES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION, MAILING, PRINT, AND DIGITAL ADVERTISING COSTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF STORE PAYROLL, CERTAIN MARKETING EXPENSES, AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES GENERALLY DO NOT VARY PROPORTIONALLY WITH NET SALES. AS A RESULT, SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES ARE USUALLY HIGHER IN LOWER VOLUME QUARTERS AND LOWER IN HIGHER VOLUME QUARTERS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2018  NET SALES  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  NET SALES (IN THOUSANDS)  $472,715  $493,605  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES  (7  )%  1%  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES  (2  )%  2%  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES PERCENTAGE CHANGE  (6  )%  1%  GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE AT END OF PERIOD (IN THOUSANDS)  5,325  5,384  NUMBER OF.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN RETAIL AND OUTLET COMPARABLE SALES, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASES IN NON-COMPARABLE SALES AND OTHER REVENUE IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF 2018  . THE DECREASE IN RETAIL COMPARABLE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED TRAFFIC AT OUR RETAIL STORES AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR RETAIL SALES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY OUR DECISION TO STRATEGICALLY REDUCE STORE-WIDE, SITE-WIDE, AND SIGNIFICANT CATEGORY PROMOTIONS. THE DECREASE IN OUR OUTLET COMPARABLE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED TRAFFIC AND A LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICE.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS PROFIT  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, GROSS PROFIT IN DOLLARS, AND GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  $346,217  $353,202  GROSS PROFIT  $126,498  $140,403  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE  26.8%  28.4%  THE  160  BASIS POINT  DECREASE  IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF 2018  WAS COMPRISED OF A  60  BASIS POINT DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND A  100  BASIS POINT INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ACTIONS TO MOVE THROUGH CLEARANCE INVENTORY, AND AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY VALUATION RESERVE FOR GOODS THAT WILL BE MARKED OUT OF STOCK IN SEPTEMBER. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REDUCTION IN PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY DURING THE QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  $135,723  $137,655  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  28.7%  27.9%  THE  $1.9 MILLION  DECREASE  IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF 2018  WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED HOME OFFICE PAYROLL, INCLUDING INCENTIVE AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, OF $2.8 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A DECREASE IN STORE PAYROLL OF $1.3 MILLION. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $2.4 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN DOLLARS FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $726  $981  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  (8.1)%  FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO  30.5%  FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  REFLECTS A TAX BENEFIT FROM A PRE-TAX LOSS OFFSET BY $0.8 MILLION OF DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE FORMER CEO\\u2019S NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING DISCRETE ITEMS, WAS 2.9% AND 29.2% FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  AND  AUGUST 4, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS LOWER THAN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  NET SALES  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  NET SALES (IN THOUSANDS)  $923,986  $972,957  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES  (8  )%  1%  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES  (2  )%  2%  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES PERCENTAGE CHANGE  (7  )%  1%  GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE AT END OF PERIOD (IN THOUSANDS)  5,325  5,384  NUMBER OF.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN RETAIL AND OUTLET COMPARABLE SALES, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASES IN NON-COMPARABLE SALES AND OTHER REVENUE IN THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN RETAIL COMPARABLE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY AT OUR STORES AND ON OUR WEBSITE. IN ADDITION, TRAFFIC CONTINUED TO BE DOWN AT OUR RETAIL STORES AND OUR OUTLET STORES.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS PROFIT  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, GROSS PROFIT IN DOLLARS, AND GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  $674,985  $689,392  GROSS PROFIT  $249,001  $283,565  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE  26.9%  29.1%  THE  220  BASIS POINT  DECREASE  IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, IN THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  WAS COMPRISED OF AN  80  BASIS POINT DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND A  140  BASIS POINT INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY VALUATION RESERVES ON SLOW MOVING INVENTORY AND THE ACTIONS WE TOOK DURING THE QUARTER TO SELL THROUGH THE INVENTORY. THE REDUCTION IN PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE FIRST QUARTER THAT CONTINUED INTO THE SECOND QUARTER PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS DECREASE. THE INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  $271,090  $278,289  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  29.3%  28.6%  THE  $7.2 MILLION  DECREASE  IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED HOME OFFICE PAYROLL, INCLUDING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, OF $6.3 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A DECREASE IN MARKETING COSTS OF $3.3 MILLION. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $3.8 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES.  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN DOLLARS FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE  $(182  )  $3,065  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  0.9%  FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO  52.7%  FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  REFLECTS A TAX BENEFIT FROM A PRE-TAX LOSS OFFSET BY $2.5 MILLION OF DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO A TAX SHORTFALL FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  REFLECTS $1.3 MILLION OF DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO A TAX SHORTFALL FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING DISCRETE ITEMS, WAS 13.4% AND 28.9% FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  AND  AUGUST 4, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 WAS LOWER THAN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE SUPPLEMENT THE REPORTING OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION DETERMINED UNDER UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (GAAP) WITH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION TO ASSIST STOCKHOLDERS IN UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ASSESSING OUR PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF, OR ARE UNRELATED TO, OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROVIDE A BETTER BASELINE FOR ANALYZING TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS USED AS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE IN OUR LONG-TERM EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF EQUITY AWARDS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY EARNED. BECAUSE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT STANDARDIZED, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO COMPARE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES WITH OTHER COMPANIES' NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVING THE SAME OR SIMILAR NAMES. THESE ADJUSTED FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR REPORTED NET INCOME AND REPORTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES REFLECT AN ADDITIONAL WAY OF VIEWING OUR OPERATIONS THAT, WHEN VIEWED WITH THE GAAP RESULTS AND THE BELOW RECONCILIATIONS TO THE CORRESPONDING GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR BUSINESS. MANAGEMENT STRONGLY ENCOURAGES INVESTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS TO REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PUBLICLY-FILED REPORTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND NOT TO RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  A SUMMARY OF CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

OUR PRIMARY OPERATING CASH NEEDS ARE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, PAYROLL, STORE RENT  AND MARKETING. FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  , OUR CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE  $1.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $7.9 MILLION  PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  . THIS  $6.1 MILLION  DECREASE IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY  $22.4 MILLION  LOWER NET INCOME FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  . THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INVENTORY PURCHASES IN 2019 AND THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BALANCES.  IN ADDITION TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, IF NEEDED, THROUGH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , WE HAD  $247.0 MILLION  AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. ON MAY 24, 2019, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE FACILITY REMAINS AT  $250.0 MILLION  BUT THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE FACILITY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO MAY 24, 2024. REFER TO NOTE 8 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WE ALSO USE CASH FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  , WE HAD CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY  $12.1 MILLION  . THESE RELATE PRIMARILY TO STORE REMODELS, NEW OUTLET STORES, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS TO SUPPORT OUR STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  TO BE APPROXIMATELY $35.0 MILLION TO $38.0 MILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STORE REMODELS, NEW OUTLET STORES, AND INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DO NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $1.0 MILLION  FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019.  ON NOVEMBER 28, 2017, THE BOARD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES US TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $150.0 MILLION  OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK USING AVAILABLE CASH. DURING THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  AND THE  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  , WE REPURCHASED  0.9 MILLION  SHARES AND  4.0 MILLION  SHARES UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, RESPECTIVELY, FOR AGGREGATE AMOUNTS EQUAL TO  $4.9 MILLION  AND  $32.0 MILLION  , INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE  $44.7 MILLION  REMAINING UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION BENEFITS FROM THE FACT THAT WE GENERALLY COLLECT CASH FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS THE SAME DAY OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, WITHIN THREE TO FIVE DAYS OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE HAVE UP TO 75 DAYS TO PAY CERTAIN MERCHANDISE VENDORS AND 45 DAYS TO PAY THE MAJORITY OF OUR NON-MERCHANDISE VENDORS.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS DID NOT CHANGE MATERIALLY BETWEEN  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  AND  AUGUST 3, 2019  .

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A NETWORKING SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND SOFTWARE COMPANY, PROVIDING SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE A WIDE RANGE OF NETWORK OPERATORS TO DEPLOY AND MANAGE NEXT-GENERATION NETWORKS THAT DELIVER SERVICES TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE PROVIDE NETWORK HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT THE TRANSPORT, SWITCHING, AGGREGATION, SERVICE DELIVERY AND MANAGEMENT OF VIDEO, DATA AND VOICE TRAFFIC ON COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE USED BY COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, CABLE AND MULTISERVICE OPERATORS, WEB-SCALE PROVIDERS, SUBMARINE NETWORK OPERATORS, GOVERNMENTS, ENTERPRISES, RESEARCH AND EDUCATION (R&E) INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER EMERGING NETWORK OPERATORS.  OUR SOLUTIONS INCLUDE A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-CAPACITY NETWORKING PLATFORM PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN BE APPLIED FROM THE NETWORK CORE TO NETWORK ACCESS POINTS, AND WHICH ALLOW NETWORK OPERATORS TO SCALE CAPACITY, INCREASE TRANSMISSION SPEEDS, ALLOCATE TRAFFIC AND ADAPT DYNAMICALLY TO CHANGING END-USER SERVICE DEMANDS. WE ALSO OFFER PLATFORM SOFTWARE THAT PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND DOMAIN CONTROL OF OUR NEXT-GENERATION PACKET AND OPTICAL PLATFORMS AND AUTOMATES NETWORK LIFECYCLE OPERATIONS INCLUDING PROVISIONING EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THROUGH OUR COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF BLUE PLANET AUTOMATION SOFTWARE, WE ENABLE NETWORK OPERATORS TO USE NETWORK DATA AND ANALYTICS TO DRIVE ENHANCED AUTOMATION ACROSS MULTI-VENDOR AND MULTI-DOMAIN NETWORK ENVIRONMENTS, ACCELERATE SERVICE DELIVERY, AND ENABLE AN INCREASINGLY PREDICTIVE AND  32  AUTONOMOUS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. TO COMPLEMENT OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS, WE OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF ATTACHED AND SOFTWARE-RELATED SERVICES THAT HELP OUR CUSTOMERS TO DESIGN, OPTIMIZE, INTEGRATE, DEPLOY, MANAGE AND MAINTAIN THEIR NETWORKS AND ASSOCIATED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS. THROUGH OUR COMPLETE PORTFOLIO OF SOLUTIONS, WE ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO TRANSFORM THEIR NETWORKS INTO DYNAMIC, PROGRAMMABLE ENVIRONMENTS DRIVEN BY AUTOMATION AND ANALYTICS, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE ADAPTIVE NETWORK. OUR SOLUTIONS FOR THE ADAPTIVE NETWORK CREATE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS, ENABLING THEM TO INTRODUCE NEW REVENUE-GENERATING SERVICES, REDUCE COSTS AND MAXIMIZE THE RETURN ON THEIR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT.  REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND BUSINESS DIVERSIFICATION.  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH ACCELERATED AS WE BENEFITED MEANINGFULLY FROM STRONG NETWORK OPERATOR DEMAND FOR CAPACITY, FAVORABLE INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, AND THE CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY. OUR STRATEGY HAS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION LEADERSHIP, THE DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER BASE, AND MARKET SHARE CAPTURE. FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2018  , OUR REVENUE GREW FROM  $2.19 BILLION  TO  $2.60 BILLION  , OR APPROXIMATELY  19%  , AND OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS GREW FROM  $134.1 MILLION  TO  $253.6 MILLION  , OR APPROXIMATELY  89%  . OUR RESULTS CAN FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND, GIVEN THE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THESE REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH RATES WILL BE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM OUR EFFORTS TO PUSH THE PACE OF INNOVATION IN OUR MARKETS AND PROVIDE MARKET-LEADING OFFERINGS. KEEPING PACE WITH THE MARKET\\u2019S DEMANDS FOR TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT CAPACITY. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WE INVESTED  $406.5 MILLION  IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  14%  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  . WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENT CAPACITY AND INNOVATION EXECUTION ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATORS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT REMAINING COMPETITIVE IN THE GEOGRAPHIES, MARKETS, AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE SELL DEPENDS UPON OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN INNOVATION AND OUR ABILITY TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS EVOLVING CONSUMPTION MODELS FOR NETWORKING SOLUTIONS.  WE CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY OUR BUSINESS AND HAVE BENEFITED FROM REVENUE CONTRIBUTIONS ACROSS A DIVERSE SET OF GEOGRAPHIES, PRODUCT SOLUTIONS AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS. DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019  , WE GREW REVENUE IN OUR NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (\\u201cEMEA\\u201d) AND CARIBBEAN AND LATIN AMERICA (\\u201cCALA\\u201d) GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND ACROSS EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, WITH A DIVERSE SET OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE GREW REVENUE WITH OUR LARGEST SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS AND WE HAVE BENEFITED FROM A STRONG MARKET POSITION WITH LEADING WEB-SCALE PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE CONTINUED DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESS CAN HELP US TO COMPETE IN A DYNAMIC INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT, CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, AND BETTER WITHSTAND POTENTIAL SLOWDOWNS IN PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIES, MARKETS, CUSTOMERS OR CUSTOMER SEGMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, SALES TO WEB-SCALE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR OVERALL GROWTH AND CERTAIN OF THESE CUSTOMERS WERE AMONG OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS BY REVENUE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019  . HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THAT OUR REVENUE GROWTH FROM THESE CUSTOMERS WILL MODERATE FROM THE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL ACHIEVED TO DATE IN FISCAL 2019. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, AFTER RECENT YEARS OF STRONG GROWTH, REVENUE FROM OUR ASIA PACIFIC AND INDIA (\\u201cAPAC\\u201d) REGION DECREASED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SPENDING LEVELS AND RESULTING SALES DECLINES WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS IN INDIA. HOWEVER, THE DECREASE IN INDIA WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET WITHIN APAC BY HIGHER SALES IN JAPAN, AND THE DECREASE IN APAC WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY SALES INCREASES IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIES AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS.

QUARTER ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED  JULY 31, 2018  AS OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ADOPTED ASC 606 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD.

REVENUE  DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , APPROXIMATELY  15.6%  OF OUR REVENUE WAS NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED, INCLUDING SALES IN EUROS, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLARS, BRAZILIAN REAIS, INDIAN RUPEES, ARGENTINA PESOS, BRITISH POUNDS AND MEXICAN PESOS. DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2018  , THE U.S. DOLLAR GENERALLY STRENGTHENED AGAINST THESE CURRENCIES. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR REVENUE REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS WAS REDUCED SLIGHTLY BY APPROXIMATELY  $8.2 MILLION  , OR  1.0%  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2018  .

FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, NET SALES DECLINED DUE TO THE CYTOSPORT DIVESTITURE.  FOR THE THIRD QUARTER, SEGMENT PROFIT DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF CYTOSPORT, THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AVOCADO COSTS ON MEGAMEX EARNINGS, AND LOWER  SKIPPY  \\u00ae  PEANUT BUTTER PRICING.  SEGMENT PROFIT DECREASED FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 ON LOWER EQUITY IN EARNINGS FROM MEGAMEX, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AVOCADO COSTS AND A NON-OPERATING TAX BENEFIT LAST YEAR.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES LOWER VOLUME AND SALES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF CYTOSPORT AND LOWER PRICES ON  SKIPPY  \\u00ae  PEANUT BUTTER PRODUCTS.  SEGMENT PROFIT IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE SLIGHTLY YEAR-OVER-YEAR AS THE CORE BUSINESS OFFSETS THE IMPACT OF THE CYTOSPORT DIVESTITURE AND A $17.3 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF THE CYTOSPORT TRADEMARK LAST YEAR.

REFRIGERATED FOODS SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED PROFITABILITY FOR VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS. FAVORABLE OPERATIONAL EXPENSES AND HIGHER COMMODITY PROFITS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE EARNINGS GROWTH.  SEGMENT PROFIT FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS INCREASED AS VALUE-ADDED PROFITS MORE THAN OFFSET COMMODITY PROFIT DECLINES FROM PRIOR QUARTERS.  LOOKING AHEAD TO THE FOURTH QUARTER, REFRIGERATED FOODS IS EXPECTED TO GROW VOLUME AND SALES DUE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS.  SEGMENT PROFIT IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE DUE TO LOWER COMMODITY PROFITS AND HIGHER INPUT COSTS.  THE IMPACT OF AFRICAN SWINE FEVER PRESENTS ADDITIONAL RISK TO INPUT COSTS.

SEGMENT PROFIT FOR THE QUARTER WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN CHINA.  FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, VOLUME, SALES, AND SEGMENT PROFIT CONTINUED TO BE IMPACTED BY TARIFFS ON FRESH PORK EXPORTS AND LOWER EQUITY IN EARNINGS.  THESE FACTORS MORE THAN OFFSET STRONG RESULTS FROM THE CHINA BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES VOLUME, SALES, AND EARNINGS DECLINES DUE TO LOWER EXPORTS AND THE DIVESTITURE OF CYTOSPORT.  PORK EXPORTS REMAIN A RISK DUE TO GLOBAL TRADE UNCERTAINTY.  UNALLOCATED INCOME AND EXPENSES  THE COMPANY DOES NOT ALLOCATE INVESTMENT INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, OR INTEREST INCOME TO ITS SEGMENTS WHEN MEASURING PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY ALSO RETAINS VARIOUS OTHER INCOME AND UNALLOCATED EXPENSES AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES IS INCLUDED IN SEGMENT PROFIT; HOWEVER, EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE EXCLUDED.  THESE ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SEGMENT TABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECONCILING SEGMENT RESULTS TO EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES.

NET UNALLOCATED EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED DUE TO A ONE-TIME GAIN RESULTING FROM THE CYTOSPORT DIVESTITURE, THE BENEFIT FROM A LEGAL SETTLEMENT, AND LOWER SELLING EXPENSES.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE INFORMATION REGARDING RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 28, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE  $560.2 MILLION  AT THE END OF THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO $269.0 MILLION  AT THE END OF THE COMPARABLE FISCAL 2018 PERIOD.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $572.9 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  $743.2 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  THE DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTED TO HIGHER LEVELS OF WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN ELEVATED LEVEL OF INVENTORY.  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $354.9 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $1,096.0 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $473.9 MILLION FOR THE SALE OF CYTOSPORT.  IN FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SPENT $857.4 MILLION ON THE ACQUISITION OF COLUMBUS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FIRST  NINE MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED TO  $154.2 MILLION  FROM  $244.0 MILLION  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS FISCAL 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE APPROXIMATELY $250.0 MILLION.  KEY PROJECTS FOR THE FULL YEAR INCLUDE AN EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S BURKE CORPORATION PIZZA-TOPPINGS FACILITY IN NEVADA, IOWA, AND FONTANINI FACILITY IN MCCOOK, ILL., ALONG WITH OTHER PROJECTS DESIGNED TO INCREASE VALUE-ADDED CAPACITY.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $826.0 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $177.3 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY REPAID $374.8 MILLION OF DEBT RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF COLUMBUS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE HIGHER CASH PROVIDED IN FISCAL 2018 IS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF COLUMBUS AS THE COMPANY BORROWED  $375.0 MILLION  UNDER A TERM LOAN FACILITY AND  $375.0 MILLION  UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND THE PURCHASE, WITH $280.0 MILLION PAID DOWN DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS.  THE COMPANY REPURCHASED  $174.2 MILLION  OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN THE FIRST  NINE MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  $44.7 MILLION  REPURCHASED DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S SHARE REPURCHASE PLANS OR PROGRAMS, SEE PART II, ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.  CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS CONTINUE TO BE AN ONGOING FINANCING ACTIVITY FOR THE COMPANY.  DIVIDENDS PAID IN THE FIRST  NINE MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 WERE $325.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO $288.5 MILLION  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  FOR FISCAL 2019, THE ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE WAS INCREASED TO  $0.84  PER SHARE, REPRESENTING THE 53RD CONSECUTIVE ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCREASE.  THE COMPANY HAS PAID DIVIDENDS FOR 364 CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE DOING SO.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED BY CERTAIN COVENANTS IN ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF FINANCIAL RATIOS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.  AT THE END OF THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THESE DEBT COVENANTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH ITS PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO CASH FLOWS FROM THIS SOURCE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A RELATIVELY STABLE INDUSTRY AND HAS STRONG BRANDS ACROSS MANY PRODUCT LINES.  THE COMPANY IS DEDICATED TO RETURNING EXCESS CASH FLOW TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  GROWING THE BUSINESS THROUGH INNOVATION AND EVALUATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS REMAINS A FOCUS FOR THE COMPANY.  REINVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS TO ENSURE EMPLOYEE AND FOOD SAFETY ARE A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE COMPANY.  CAPITAL SPENDING TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND CURRENT OPERATIONS WILL ALSO BE A SIGNIFICANT CASH OUTFLOW FOR FISCAL 2019.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  THE COMPANY RECORDS INCOME TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  .

SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE SET FORTH HEREIN; OPERATIONS DISRUPTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION; OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN QUALIFIED SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND SERVICE TECHNICIANS WHO RELATE DIRECTLY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS; THE REDUCTION, MODIFICATION, CANCELLATION OR DELAY OF PURCHASES OF INNOVATIVE, HIGH-MARGIN EQUIPMENT; MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR PURCHASING RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS; CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND THE OTHER RISKS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS CONTAINED AND IDENTIFIED IN PATTERSON\\u2019S PREVIOUS FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, SUCH AS ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, ANY OF WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  IS SUMMARIZED IN THIS MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE FOLLOWING BACKGROUND IS PROVIDED TO READERS TO ASSIST IN THE REVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  WE PRESENT THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: DENTAL, ANIMAL HEALTH AND CORPORATE. DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH ARE STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNITS THAT OFFER SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO DIFFERENT CUSTOMER BASES. DENTAL PROVIDES A VIRTUALLY COMPLETE RANGE OF CONSUMABLE DENTAL PRODUCTS, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE, TURNKEY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS AND VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO DENTISTS AND DENTAL LABORATORIES THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA. ANIMAL HEALTH IS A LEADING, FULL-LINE DISTRIBUTOR IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE U.K. OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BOTH THE PRODUCTION-ANIMAL AND COMPANION-PET MARKETS. OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING HOME OFFICE SUPPORT COSTS IN AREAS SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, FINANCE, LEGAL, HUMAN RESOURCES AND FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMER FINANCING AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SALES ARE REPORTED WITHIN CORPORATE RESULTS.  OPERATING MARGINS OF THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE DENTAL BUSINESS. WHILE OPERATING EXPENSES RUN AT A LOWER RATE IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS WHEN COMPARED TO THE DENTAL BUSINESS, GROSS MARGINS IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER DUE GENERALLY TO THE LOW MARGINS EXPERIENCED ON THE SALE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.  WE OPERATE WITH A 52-53 WEEK ACCOUNTING CONVENTION WITH OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL. THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019 REPRESENTS THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  AND THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FISCAL 2020 WILL INCLUDE 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED 52 WEEKS.  WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS THAT ARE USEFUL IN ANALYZING IT, INCLUDING: (1) GROWTH IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE; (2) INTERNAL GROWTH; (3) GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITION; AND (4) CONTINUED FOCUS ON CONTROLLING COSTS AND ENHANCING EFFICIENCY. MANAGEMENT DEFINES INTERNAL GROWTH AS THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN THE NUMBER OF WEEKS IN FISCAL YEARS, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND EXCLUDING THE NET SALES, FOR A PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION DATE, OF BUSINESSES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION PROGRAM.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH MUFG BANK, LTD. (\\\"MUFG\\\"). UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, MUFG ACTS AS AN AGENT TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN PATTERSON RECEIVABLES (THE \\u201cRECEIVABLES\\u201d) TO CERTAIN UNAFFILIATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (THE \\u201cPURCHASERS\\u201d).  THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE RECEIVABLES COMPRISE A COMBINATION OF CASH AND A DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE (\\u201cDPP\\u201d) RECEIVABLE. THE INITIAL TRANSACTION WAS A SALE OF $237.6 MILLION OF NET RECEIVABLES.  FROM THIS SALE, WE RECEIVED $171.0 MILLION OF CASH AND A DPP RECEIVABLE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $65.9 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED A LOSS OF $0.7 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE INITIAL SALE WERE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE DEBT.  THE DPP RECEIVABLE IS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY PATTERSON FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES SOLD TO THE PURCHASERS. THE COLLECTION OF THE DPP RECEIVABLE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN INCREASE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  GAIN ON INVESTMENT  . WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $34.3 MILLION RELATED TO ONE OF OUR INVESTMENTS (\\\"GAIN ON INVESTMENT\\\") DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THIS GAIN WAS BASED ON THE SELLING PRICE OF PREFERRED STOCK IN THIS INVESTMENT THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE PREFERRED STOCK WE OWN, AND WAS ADJUSTED FOR DIFFERENCES IN LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES.  FISCAL 2020 LEGAL RESERVE  . WE INCURRED EXPENSES OF $17.7 MILLION (\\\" FISCAL 2020 LEGAL RESERVE\\\") DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF  LITIGATION WITH SOURCEONE DENTAL, INC.  SEE \\\"ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\\" FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  FISCAL 2019 LEGAL RESERVE  . IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LITIGATION ENTITLED  IN RE DENTAL SUPPLIES ANTITRUST LITIGATION  . UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT, WE PAID $28.3 MILLION INTO ESCROW UPON PRELIMINARY COURT APPROVAL.  SUCH FUNDS ARE TO BE RELEASED TO THE SETTLEMENT FUND ADMINISTRATOR UPON FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT, WHICH WAS GRANTED AT THE FAIRNESS HEARING HELD ON JUNE 24, 2019. WE ESTABLISHED A PRE-TAX RESERVE OF $28.3 MILLION (\\\"FISCAL 2019 LEGAL RESERVE\\\") DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER. SEE \\\"ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\\" FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE  $1,328.7 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  0.6%  FROM  $1,336.3 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF  0.7%  ON CURRENT QUARTER SALES. SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS WERE RECOGNIZED ON A NET BASIS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED 0.3% UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO SALES.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DENTAL SEGMENT SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE  $501.1 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  1.0%  FROM  $506.1 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF  0.2%  ON CURRENT QUARTER SALES. CURRENT QUARTER SALES OF CONSUMABLES DECREASED  0.7%  , SALES OF DENTAL EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE DECREASED  6.9%  , AND SALES OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES AND OTHER INCREASED  9.8%.  ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE  $817.5 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  0.9%  FROM  $825.2 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF  1.0%  ON CURRENT QUARTER SALES. SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS WERE RECOGNIZED ON A NET BASIS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED 0.4% UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO SALES.  GROSS PROFIT.  THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  INCREASED  60  BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER TO  21.8%  . GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATES INCREASED IN BOTH THE DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , AND HIGHER NET SALES IN OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT RELATED TO CUSTOMER FINANCING CONTRACTS POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE  $273.4 MILLION  , A  2.1%  DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER OF  $279.1 MILLION  . WE INCURRED HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FISCAL 2019 LEGAL RESERVE BEING APPROXIMATELY $10.6 MILLION GREATER THAN THE FISCAL 2020 LEGAL RESERVE. THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSE RATIO OF  20.5%  DECREASED  40  BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WHICH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY THIS SAME FACTOR.  OPERATING INCOME.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , OPERATING INCOME WAS  $16.7 MILLION  , OR  1.3%  OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO  $4.5 MILLION  , OR  0.3%  OF NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER LEGAL RESERVE RECORDED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  , AS WELL AS HIGHER GROSS MARGINS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  . THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS DRIVEN BY THESE SAME FACTORS.  DENTAL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $34.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $1.9 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES.  ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $19.6 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , AN INCREASE OF  $0.6 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATES.  CORPORATE SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS WAS  $37.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF  $50.4 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . THE CHANGE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE HIGHER LEGAL RESERVE RECORDED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  , AS WELL AS HIGHER NET SALES RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING CONTRACTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  NET OTHER INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WAS  $23.2 MILLION  , COMPARED TO NET OTHER EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  OF  $10.0 MILLION  . NET OTHER INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WAS DRIVEN BY THE GAIN ON INVESTMENT OF $34.3 MILLION.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)  . THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  REFLECTED INCOME TAX EXPENSE AT  25.3%  AS COMPARED TO AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT AT  17.3%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  .  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATTERSON COMPANIES INC. AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATTERSON COMPANIES INC. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WAS  $30.0 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $(4.5) MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE WERE  $0.32  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED TO  $(0.05)  IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WERE  94.6 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  92.5 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $96.8 MILLION  , COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $7.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  . NET CASH FLOWS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WERE POSITIVE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COLLECTION OF  $105.7 MILLION  OF DPP RECEIVABLES. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  $8.9 MILLION  AND  $10.2 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  AND  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT TO USE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL  2020.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 27, 2019  WAS  $36.2 MILLION  . USES OF CASH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF  $25.5 MILLION  FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND  $5.5 MILLION  FOR THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT. FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 28, 2018  , NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $183.8 MILLION  . USES OF CASH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF  $176.6 MILLION  FOR THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND  $25.3 MILLION  FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND CASH PROCEEDS INCLUDED  $16.0 MILLION  ATTRIBUTED TO DRAWS ON OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT.  IN FISCAL 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT (\\u201cAMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d), CONSISTING OF A $295.1 MILLION TERM LOAN AND A $750 MILLION REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT.  IN MARCH 2019, WE PERMANENTLY REDUCED THE CAPACITY UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT TO $500 MILLION. INTEREST ON BORROWINGS IS VARIABLE AND IS DETERMINED AS A BASE RATE PLUS A SPREAD. THIS SPREAD, AS WELL AS A COMMITMENT FEE ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE FACILITY, IS BASED ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES WILL MATURE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 2022. AS OF  JULY 27, 2019  , $81.6 MILLION OF THE UNSECURED TERM LOAN WAS OUTSTANDING AT AN INTEREST RATE OF 3.5%, AND NO AMOUNT WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT. AS OF APRIL 27, 2019, $87.1 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE UNSECURED TERM LOAN AT AN INTEREST RATE OF 3.7%, AND NO AMOUNT WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT.  WE EXPECT FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, EXISTING CASH BALANCES AND CREDIT AVAILABILITY UNDER EXISTING DEBT FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND TO FINANCE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OVER THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2020.

OVERVIEW  OUR COMMUNITY COUNT DECREASED 6.1% SEQUENTIALLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, FROM 147 COMMUNITIES AT APRIL 30, 2019 TO 138 AT JULY 31, 2019, AND INCREASED 12.2% FROM 123 COMMUNITIES AT JULY 31, 2018. THE SEQUENTIAL DECREASE OCCURRED AS OUR SALES PACE WAS FASTER THAN EXPECTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AND AS A RESULT, WE SOLD OUT OF MORE COMMUNITIES THAN EXPECTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF LOTS CONTROLLED INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH IS THE SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER FOR WHICH WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A YEAR-OVER-YEAR QUARTERLY INCREASE. WE BELIEVE CONTINUED GROWTH IN LOTS CONTROLLED SHOULD LEAD TO FURTHER COMMUNITY COUNT GROWTH. HOWEVER, THERE IS TYPICALLY A SIGNIFICANT TIME LAG FROM WHEN WE FIRST CONTROL LOTS UNTIL THE TIME THAT WE OPEN A COMMUNITY FOR SALE. THIS TIMELINE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM A FEW MONTHS (IN A MARKET SUCH AS HOUSTON) TO THREE TO FIVE PLUS YEARS (IN A MARKET SUCH AS NEW JERSEY). WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND GIVEN THE MIX OF LAND THAT WE CONTROL AND THE LAND INVESTMENT WE ANTICIPATE, WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT OUR COMMUNITY COUNT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. ULTIMATELY, COMMUNITY COUNT GROWTH, ABSENT ADVERSE MARKET FACTORS, SHOULD LEAD TO DELIVERY AND REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.  OUR CASH POSITION DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 ALLOWED US TO SPEND $400.0 MILLION ON LAND PURCHASES AND LAND DEVELOPMENT DURING THE PERIOD, AND STILL HAVE TOTAL LIQUIDITY OF $225.1 MILLION, INCLUDING $83.6 MILLION OF HOMEBUILDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF JULY 31, 2019. WE CONTINUE TO SEE OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE LAND AT PRICES THAT MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE IN LIGHT OF OUR CURRENT SALES PRICES, SALES PACE AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND PLAN TO CONTINUE ACTIVELY PURSUING SUCH LAND ACQUISITIONS. NEW LAND PURCHASES AT PRICING THAT WE BELIEVE WILL GENERATE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DRIVE GREATER OPERATING EFFICIENCIES ARE NEEDED TO RETURN TO SUSTAINED PROFITABILITY; HOWEVER, WE REMAIN CAUTIOUS AND ARE CAREFULLY EVALUATING MARKET CONDITIONS WHEN PURSUING NEW LAND ACQUISITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, AMONG OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS, WE ARE CAREFULLY MONITORING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE CURRENT TRADE AND TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS AND THE RELATED MARKET VOLATILITY ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TARIFFS RECENTLY IMPOSED ON PRODUCTS FROM CHINA AND ELSEWHERE HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS TO DATE, FUTURE TARIFFS OR THE THREAT THEREOF MAY HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND ON OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 BUDGETS.  ADDITIONAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \\u25cf FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, SALE OF HOMES REVENUES INCREASED 5.6% AND DECREASED 4.2%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A RESULT OF A 3.8% INCREASE AND 4.3% DECREASE IN DELIVERIES, RESPECTIVELY. THE QUARTERLY INCREASE WAS THE FIRST YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN REVENUES AND DELIVERIES SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016.  \\u25cf GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED FROM 15.4% AND 14.6% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, TO 14.0% FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES, WAS FLAT AT 18.4% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018 AND DECREASED FROM 18.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO 17.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  \\u25cf SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS (INCLUDING CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES) INCREASED $4.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND $1.3 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE, SUCH COSTS INCREASED FROM 11.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO 12.1% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND INCREASED FROM 12.9% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO 13.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019.  \\u25cf ACTIVE SELLING COMMUNITIES INCREASED 12.2% OVER LAST YEAR\\u2019S THIRD QUARTER.

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES, INCREASED FROM 16.9% TO 18.4% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASED INCENTIVES DURING THE QUARTER. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS (INCLUDING CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES) DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM $60.3 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO $58.5 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $1.6 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED EXPENSE OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE BASED MARKET STOCK UNITS AWARDS FOR WHICH THE PERFORMANCE METRICS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE SATISFIED. AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES, THESE COSTS DECREASED FROM 13.7% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO 12.1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUES. IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT AREA OF FOCUS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  AS DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018, OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATE TO INCOME RECOGNITION FROM MORTGAGE LOANS; INVENTORIES; UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES; POST-DEVELOPMENT COMPLETION, WARRANTY AND INSURANCE RESERVES; AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. SINCE OCTOBER 31, 2018, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THOSE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  OUR OPERATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND SALES IN THE NORTHEAST (NEW JERSEY AND PENNSYLVANIA), THE MID-ATLANTIC (DELAWARE, MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, WASHINGTON D.C. AND WEST VIRGINIA), THE MIDWEST (ILLINOIS AND OHIO), THE SOUTHEAST (FLORIDA, GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA), THE SOUTHWEST (ARIZONA AND TEXAS) AND THE WEST (CALIFORNIA). IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL SERVICES TO OUR HOMEBUILDING CUSTOMERS.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED OUR HOMEBUILDING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATIONS WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, THE ISSUANCE OF NEW DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES. DUE TO COVENANT RESTRICTIONS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE CAN INCUR THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS REFINANCING INDEBTEDNESS WITH CERTAIN MATURITY REQUIREMENTS (A LIMITATION THAT WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE), EVEN IF MARKET CONDITIONS WOULD OTHERWISE BE FAVORABLE, WHICH COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.  OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES \\u2013 OVERVIEW  OUR HOMEBUILDING CASH BALANCE AT JULY 31, 2019 DECREASED $104.2 MILLION FROM OCTOBER 31, 2018. WE SPENT $400.0 MILLION ON LAND AND LAND DEVELOPMENT DURING THE PERIOD. AFTER CONSIDERING THIS LAND AND LAND DEVELOPMENT AND ALL OTHER OPERATING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING REVENUE RECEIVED FROM DELIVERIES, WE USED $258.1 MILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD $125.0 MILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY (DEFINED BELOW), AND THEREFORE, OUR TOTAL LIQUIDITY AT JULY 31, 2019 WAS $225.1 MILLION, WHICH IS WITHIN OUR TARGET LIQUIDITY RANGE OF $170.0 TO $245.0 MILLION. DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, WE USED $9.5 MILLION OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY FOR INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DISTRIBUTIONS FROM JOINT VENTURES. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $159.4 MILLION DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH INCLUDED PROCEEDS OF $21.3 MILLION FROM A DEBT ISSUANCE, $75.8 MILLION FROM LAND BANKING AND MODEL SALE LEASEBACK PROGRAMS AND $112.5 MILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM NONRECOURSE MORTGAGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $46.3 MILLION REDUCTION IN MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE LINES OF CREDIT. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO USE NONRECOURSE MORTGAGE FINANCINGS, MODEL SALE LEASEBACK, JOINT VENTURES, AND, SUBJECT TO COVENANT RESTRICTIONS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, LAND BANKING PROGRAMS AS OUR BUSINESS NEEDS DICTATE.  OUR CASH USES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE FOR OPERATING EXPENSES, LAND PURCHASES, LAND DEPOSITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION SPENDING, DEBT PAYMENTS, STATE INCOME TAXES, INTEREST PAYMENTS, LITIGATION MATTERS AND INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES. DURING THESE PERIODS, WE PROVIDED FOR OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, HOUSING AND LAND SALES, FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, MODEL SALE LEASEBACKS, LAND BANKING TRANSACTIONS, JOINT VENTURES, FINANCIAL SERVICE REVENUES AND OTHER REVENUES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE SOURCES OF CASH TOGETHER WITH OUR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT THROUGH FISCAL 2019 TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  OUR NET INCOME (LOSS) HISTORICALLY DOES NOT APPROXIMATE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NET INCOME (LOSS) AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INVENTORY LEVELS TOGETHER WITH CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES, PREPAID AND OTHER ASSETS, MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR SALE, INTEREST AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES, AND NONCASH CHARGES RELATING TO DEPRECIATION, STOCK COMPENSATION AWARDS AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES FOR INVENTORY. WHEN WE ARE EXPANDING OUR OPERATIONS, INVENTORY LEVELS, PREPAIDS AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASE CAUSING CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO DECREASE. CERTAIN LIABILITIES ALSO INCREASE AS OPERATIONS EXPAND AND PARTIALLY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS CAUSED BY THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY LEVELS, PREPAIDS AND OTHER ASSETS. SIMILARLY, AS OUR MORTGAGE OPERATIONS EXPAND, NET INCOME FROM THESE OPERATIONS INCREASES, BUT FOR CASH FLOW PURPOSES NET INCOME IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NET CHANGE IN MORTGAGE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE AS OUR INVESTMENT IN NEW LAND PURCHASES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW COMMUNITIES DECREASE, CAUSING US TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. IN FISCAL 2019 AND 2018, WITH CONTINUED SPENDING ON LAND PURCHASES AND LAND DEVELOPMENT, WE USED CASH IN OPERATIONS.

AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE BELIEVE WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  IF OUR CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, IS LESS THAN 2.0 TO 1.0, WE ARE RESTRICTED FROM MAKING CERTAIN PAYMENTS, INCLUDING DIVIDENDS, AND FROM INCURRING INDEBTEDNESS OTHER THAN CERTAIN PERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS, REFINANCING INDEBTEDNESS AND NONRECOURSE INDEBTEDNESS. AS A RESULT OF THIS RATIO RESTRICTION, WE ARE CURRENTLY RESTRICTED FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS, WHICH ARE NOT CUMULATIVE, ON OUR 7.625% SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESTRICTED FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR INABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH COVENANT RESTRICTIONS AND WILL NOT RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT COMPLIANCE WITH ANY OF THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE CERTAIN REDEMPTIONS AND PREPAYMENTS AND, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COVENANT RESTRICTIONS, MAY DO SO FROM TIME TO TIME. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY ANALYZE AND EVALUATE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND EXPLORE TRANSACTIONS TO SIMPLIFY OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND WILL SEEK TO DO SO WITH THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY. WE MAY ALSO CONTINUE TO MAKE DEBT PURCHASES AND/OR EXCHANGES FOR DEBT OR EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH TENDER OFFERS, OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS, OR OTHERWISE, OR SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COVENANT RESTRICTIONS.  ANY LIQUIDITY-ENHANCING OR OTHER CAPITAL RAISING OR REFINANCING TRANSACTION WILL DEPEND ON IDENTIFYING COUNTERPARTIES, NEGOTIATION OF DOCUMENTATION AND APPLICABLE CLOSING CONDITIONS AND ANY REQUIRED APPROVALS. DUE TO COVENANT RESTRICTIONS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF DEBT WE CAN INCUR THAT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS REFINANCING INDEBTEDNESS WITH CERTAIN MATURITY REQUIREMENTS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE (A LIMITATION THAT WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE), EVEN IF MARKET CONDITIONS WOULD OTHERWISE BE FAVORABLE, WHICH COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.  IN ADDITION TO THE SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAVE CERTAIN STAND\\u2013ALONE CASH COLLATERALIZED LETTER OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND FACILITIES UNDER WHICH THERE WAS A TOTAL OF $15.9 MILLION AND $12.5 MILLION LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AGREEMENTS AND FACILITIES REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF CASH AS COLLATERAL IN SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS TO SUPPORT THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED THEREUNDER, WHICH WILL AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE HAVE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER USES. AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, THE AMOUNT OF CASH COLLATERAL IN THESE SEGREGATED ACCOUNTS WAS $16.5 MILLION AND $12.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN \\u201cRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\\u201d ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND K. HOVNANIAN\\u2019S SENIOR SECURED NOTES AND SENIOR NOTES.  MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE  WE HAVE NONRECOURSE MORTGAGE LOANS FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITIES TOTALING $207.2 MILLION AND $95.6 MILLION (NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS) AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE SECURED BY THE RELATED REAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPROVEMENTS, WITH AN AGGREGATE BOOK VALUE OF $409.3 MILLION AND $241.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THESE OBLIGATIONS WAS 8.1% AND 6.1% AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE MORTGAGE LOAN PAYMENTS ON EACH COMMUNITY PRIMARILY CORRESPOND TO HOME DELIVERIES.  OUR WHOLLY OWNED MORTGAGE BANKING SUBSIDIARY, K. HOVNANIAN AMERICAN MORTGAGE, LLC (\\u201cK. HOVNANIAN MORTGAGE\\u201d), ORIGINATES MORTGAGE LOANS PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF OUR HOMES. SUCH MORTGAGE LOANS AND RELATED SERVICING RIGHTS ARE SOLD IN THE SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WE RETAIN THE SERVICING RIGHTS FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF LOANS. THE LOANS ARE SECURED BY THE MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE AND REPAID WHEN WE SELL THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS TO PERMANENT INVESTORS. AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE OF $66.9 MILLION AND $113.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OUTSTANDING UNDER SEVERAL OF K. HOVNANIAN MORTGAGE\\u2019S SHORT-TERM BORROWING FACILITIES.  SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE AGREEMENTS.  INVENTORY ACTIVITIES  TOTAL INVENTORY, EXCLUDING CONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED, INCREASED $185.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 FROM OCTOBER 31, 2018. TOTAL INVENTORY, EXCLUDING CONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED, INCREASED IN THE NORTHEAST BY $32.9 MILLION, IN THE MID-ATLANTIC BY $40.3 MILLION, IN THE MIDWEST BY $15.6 MILLION, IN THE SOUTHEAST BY $15.8 MILLION, IN THE SOUTHWEST BY $51.7 MILLION AND IN THE WEST BY $28.8 MILLION. THE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW LAND PURCHASES AND LAND DEVELOPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HOME DELIVERIES DURING THE PERIOD. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD IMPAIRMENTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.1 MILLION. WE WROTE-OFF COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $2.5 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 RELATED TO LAND OPTIONS THAT EXPIRED OR THAT WE TERMINATED, AS THE COMMUNITIES\\u2019 FORECASTED PROFITABILITY WAS NOT PROJECTED TO PRODUCE ADEQUATE RETURNS ON INVESTMENT COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE NEW LAND PARCELS AT PRICES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL GENERATE REASONABLE RETURNS UNDER CURRENT HOMEBUILDING MARKET CONDITIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE IN THE NEAR TERM. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL HOMES UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR COMPLETED AND INCLUDED IN INVENTORY AT JULY 31, 2019 ARE EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED DURING THE NEXT SIX TO NINE MONTHS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED INCREASED $91.7 MILLION. CONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED CONSISTS OF OPTIONS RELATED TO LAND BANKING AND MODEL FINANCING TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE ADDED TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP. THE INCREASE FROM OCTOBER 31, 2018 TO JULY 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LAND BANKING TRANSACTIONS ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN THE SALE AND LEASEBACK OF CERTAIN MODEL HOMES DURING THE PERIOD. WE HAVE LAND BANKING ARRANGEMENTS, WHEREBY WE SELL LAND PARCELS TO THE LAND BANKERS AND THEY PROVIDE US AN OPTION TO PURCHASE BACK FINISHED LOTS ON A PREDETERMINED SCHEDULE. BECAUSE OF OUR OPTIONS TO REPURCHASE THESE PARCELS, FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606-10-55-70, THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CONSIDERED A FINANCING RATHER THAN A SALE. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AT JULY 31, 2019, INVENTORY OF $123.8 MILLION WAS RECORDED TO \\u201cCONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED,\\u201d WITH A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF $87.7 MILLION (NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS) RECORDED TO \\u201cLIABILITIES FROM INVENTORY NOT OWNED\\u201d FOR THE AMOUNT OF NET CASH RECEIVED FROM THE TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE SELL AND LEASE BACK CERTAIN OF OUR MODEL HOMES WITH THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POTENTIAL PROFIT WHEN EACH HOME IS SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY AT THE END OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASE. AS A RESULT OF OUR CONTINUED INVOLVEMENT, FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606-10-55-68, THESE SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ARE CONSIDERED A FINANCING RATHER THAN A SALE. THEREFORE, FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AT JULY 31, 2019, INVENTORY OF $55.8 MILLION WAS RECORDED TO \\u201cCONSOLIDATED INVENTORY NOT OWNED,\\u201d WITH A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF $50.7 MILLION (NET OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS) RECORDED TO \\u201cLIABILITIES FROM INVENTORY NOT OWNED\\u201d FOR THE AMOUNT OF NET CASH RECEIVED FROM THE TRANSACTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO OPTION AGREEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS, WHEREBY WE ARE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF LOTS. BECAUSE OF OUR OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE THESE LOTS, FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360-20-40-38, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECORD THIS INVENTORY ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD NO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OPTIONS.  WHEN POSSIBLE, WE OPTION PROPERTY FOR DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO ACQUISITION. BY OPTIONING PROPERTY, WE ARE ONLY SUBJECT TO THE LOSS OF THE COST OF THE OPTION AND PREDEVELOPMENT COSTS IF WE CHOOSE NOT TO EXERCISE THE OPTION (OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OPTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE). AS A RESULT, OUR COMMITMENT FOR MAJOR LAND ACQUISITIONS IS REDUCED. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONED PROPERTIES ARE INCLUDED IN \\u201cLAND AND LAND OPTIONS HELD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OR SALE\\u201d ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ALSO INCLUDED IN \\u201cLAND AND LAND OPTIONS HELD FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OR SALE\\u201d ARE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH INVENTORY IN MOTHBALLED COMMUNITIES. WE MOTHBALL (OR STOP DEVELOPMENT ON) CERTAIN COMMUNITIES WHEN WE DETERMINE THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE DOES NOT JUSTIFY FURTHER INVESTMENT AT THE TIME. THAT IS, WE BELIEVE WE WILL GENERATE HIGHER RETURNS IF WE DECIDE AGAINST SPENDING MONEY TO IMPROVE LAND TODAY AND SAVE THE RAW LAND UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE MARKETS IMPROVE OR WE DETERMINE TO SELL THE PROPERTY. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD MOTHBALLED LAND IN 14 COMMUNITIES. THE BOOK VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE COMMUNITIES AT JULY 31, 2019 WAS $14.2 MILLION, WHICH WAS NET OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS OF $146.9 MILLION. WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW COMMUNITIES TO DETERMINE IF MOTHBALLING IS APPROPRIATE. DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, WE DID NOT MOTHBALL ANY ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES, BUT WE SOLD TWO PREVIOUSLY MOTHBALLED COMMUNITIES AND RE-ACTIVATED TWO PREVIOUSLY MOTHBALLED COMMUNITIES.  INVENTORIES HELD FOR SALE, WHICH ARE LAND PARCELS WHERE WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO BUILD HOMES AND ARE ACTIVELY MARKETING THE LAND FOR SALE, REPRESENTED $1.2 MILLION AND $6.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL INVENTORIES AT JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, AND ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE FOR LAND HELD FOR SALE, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PRICES FOR LAND IN RECENT COMPARABLE SALE TRANSACTIONS, MARKET ANALYSIS STUDIES, WHICH INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED PRICE A WILLING BUYER WOULD PAY FOR THE LAND (OTHER THAN IN A FORCED LIQUIDATION SALE) AND RECENT BONA FIDE OFFERS RECEIVED FROM OUTSIDE THIRD PARTIES.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE HOME SITES INCLUDED IN OUR TOTAL RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH COLLATERAL FOR NEW LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED DURING THE PERIOD.  INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES INCREASED $10.4 MILLION TO $134.1 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO OCTOBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCOME FROM TWO OF OUR JOINT VENTURES IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, ALONG WITH NEW CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR EXISTING JOINT VENTURES DURING THE PERIOD AND A NEW JOINT VENTURE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND OCTOBER 31, 2018, WE HAD INVESTMENTS IN 10 HOMEBUILDING JOINT VENTURES AND ONE LAND DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURE.

OTHER LIABILITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO SEVERAL NEW MUNICIPAL LOANS AND BONDS ISSUED DURING THE PERIOD.  CUSTOMERS\\u2019 DEPOSITS INCREASED $10.3 MILLION TO $40.4 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2019, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN BACKLOG DURING THE PERIOD.  LIABILITIES FROM INVENTORY NOT OWNED INCREASED $75.0 MILLION TO $138.4 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LAND BANKING ACTIVITY DURING THE PERIOD, ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN THE SALE AND LEASEBACK OF CERTAIN MODEL HOMES, BOTH ACCOUNTED FOR AS FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  FINANCIAL SERVICES (LIABILITIES) DECREASED $53.7 MILLION FROM $143.4 MILLION AT OCTOBER 31, 2018, TO $89.7 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE LINES OF CREDIT, AND DIRECTLY CORRELATES TO THE DECREASE IN THE VOLUME OF MORTGAGE LOANS HELD FOR SALE DURING THE PERIOD.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018  TOTAL REVENUES  COMPARED TO THE SAME PRIOR PERIOD, REVENUES INCREASED (DECREASED) AS FOLLOWS.

THE AVERAGE PRICE PER HOME INCREASED TO $394,809 IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 FROM $387,793 IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE OVERALL INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED HOUSING REVENUES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF DELIVERIES AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN COMMUNITY COUNT AND BY THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SALES PRICE. THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OVER YEAR QUARTERLY INCREASE IN REVENUES AND DELIVERIES SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016 AND IS THE RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS TO GROW COMMUNITY COUNT AND LOTS CONTROLLED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE OVERALL DECREASE IN CONSOLIDATED HOUSING REVENUES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE IN THE VOLUME OF DELIVERIES AS A RESULT OF NEW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NOT YET DELIVERING HOMES.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR FUTURE RESULTS ARE RECENTLY SIGNED CONTRACTS AND OUR HOME CONTRACT BACKLOG FOR FUTURE DELIVERIES.

SEE NOTE 17 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES.  IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, OUR OPEN FOR SALE COMMUNITY COUNT INCREASED TO 138 FROM 123 AT OCTOBER 31, 2018, WHICH IS THE NET RESULT OF OPENING 67 NEW COMMUNITIES AND CLOSING 49 COMMUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTING AND/OR SELLING THREE COMMUNITIES TO A NEW JOINT VENTURE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019. OUR REPORTED LEVEL OF SALES CONTRACTS (NET OF CANCELLATIONS) INCREASED AS A RESULT OF OUR HIGHER COMMUNITY COUNT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, ALONG WITH HIGHER SALES ABSORPTION. WITH RESPECT TO OUR SALES ABSORPTION, NET CONTRACTS PER AVERAGE ACTIVE SELLING COMMUNITY FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS 29.4 COMPARED TO 27.9 FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. NET CONTRACTS PER AVERAGE ACTIVE SELLING COMMUNITY WAS 11.0 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 10.0 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CANCELLATION RATES REPRESENT THE NUMBER OF CANCELLED CONTRACTS IN THE QUARTER DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF GROSS SALES CONTRACTS EXECUTED IN THE QUARTER.

CANCELLATIONS ALSO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF A BUYER\\u2019S FAILURE TO QUALIFY FOR A MORTGAGE, WHICH GENERALLY OCCURS DURING THE FIRST FEW WEEKS AFTER SIGNING. AS SHOWN IN THE TABLES ABOVE, CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN WITHIN WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A NORMAL RANGE. HOWEVER, MARKET CONDITIONS ARE UNCERTAIN AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT CANCELLATION RATES WILL BE IN THE FUTURE.  TOTAL COST OF SALES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDES EXPENSES FOR CONSOLIDATED HOUSING AND LAND AND LOT SALES, INCLUDING INVENTORY IMPAIRMENT LOSS AND LAND OPTION WRITE-OFFS (DEFINED AS \\u201cLAND CHARGES\\u201d IN THE TABLES BELOW). A BREAKOUT OF SUCH EXPENSES FOR HOUSING SALES AND HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN IS SET FORTH BELOW.  HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. THIS MEASURE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE ENABLES INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THIS MEASURE IS ALSO USEFUL INTERNALLY, HELPING MANAGEMENT EVALUATE OUR OPERATING RESULTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. IN PARTICULAR, THE MAGNITUDE AND VOLATILITY OF LAND CHARGES FOR THE COMPANY, AND FOR OTHER HOMEBUILDERS, HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND, AS SUCH, HAVE MADE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF OUR INDUSTRY MORE DIFFICULT. HOMEBUILDING METRICS EXCLUDING LAND CHARGES, AS WELL AS INTEREST AMORTIZED TO COST OF SALES, AND OTHER SIMILAR PRESENTATIONS PREPARED BY ANALYSTS AND OTHER COMPANIES ARE FREQUENTLY USED TO ASSIST INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING AND COMPARING THE OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS OF HOMEBUILDING ACTIVITIES BY ELIMINATING MANY OF THE DIFFERENCES IN COMPANIES\\u2019 RESPECTIVE LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENTS AND LEVELS OF DEBT.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31,  NINE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  2019  2018  SALE OF HOMES  $467,849  $442,859  $1,257,536  $1,312,553  COST OF SALES, EXCLUDING INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES  381,906  361,303  1,034,953  1,076,132  HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN, BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES  85,943  81,556  222,583  236,421  COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE, EXCLUDING LAND SALES INTEREST EXPENSE  18,824  13,424  42,964  41,025  HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN, AFTER COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE, BEFORE LAND CHARGES  67,119  68,132  179,619  195,396  LAND CHARGES  1,435  96  3,601  3,183  HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN  $65,684  $68,036  $176,018  $192,213  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE  14.0%  15.4%  14.0%  14.6%  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES  18.4%  18.4%  17.7%  18.0%  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AFTER COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE, BEFORE LAND CHARGES  14.3%  15.4%  14.3%  14.9%  COST OF SALES EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED HOME SALES REVENUES ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

AS A RESULT, DEPENDING ON THE MIX OF COMMUNITIES DELIVERING HOMES, CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN MAY FLUCTUATE UP OR DOWN. TOTAL HOMEBUILDING GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED TO 14.0% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 15.4% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND DECREASED TO 14.0% DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 14.6% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN COST OF SALES INTEREST AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF INTEREST PER HOME FOR DELIVERIES IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SEMI-ANNUAL COMMUNITY LIFE PLANNING PROCESS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE IS THE MIX OF COMMUNITIES DELIVERING COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR, ALONG WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN DIRECT COSTS AND FINANCING CONCESSIONS. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, GROSS MARGIN WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE REVERSAL OF PRIOR PERIOD INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS OF $26.7 MILLION AND $41.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH REPRESENTED 2.1% AND 3.1%, RESPECTIVELY, OF \\u201cSALE OF HOMES\\u201d REVENUE. GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, BEFORE COST OF SALES INTEREST EXPENSE AND LAND CHARGES, REMAINED THE SAME AT 18.4% FOR BOTH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 AND JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AND DECREASED FROM 18.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO 17.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MIX OF COMMUNITIES DELIVERING HOMES IN EACH PERIOD, ALONG WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN DIRECT COSTS AND FINANCING CONCESSIONS.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REFLECTED AS INVENTORY IMPAIRMENT LOSS AND LAND OPTION WRITE-OFFS IN COST OF SALES, WE HAVE WRITTEN-OFF OR WRITTEN-DOWN CERTAIN INVENTORIES TOTALING $1.4 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND $3.6 MILLION AND $3.2 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, WE WROTE-OFF RESIDENTIAL LAND OPTIONS AND APPROVAL AND ENGINEERING COSTS AMOUNTING TO $1.3 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $0.1 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL LAND CHARGES DISCUSSED ABOVE. WHEN A COMMUNITY IS REDESIGNED OR ABANDONED, ENGINEERING COSTS ARE WRITTEN-OFF. OPTION, APPROVAL AND ENGINEERING COSTS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN A COMMUNITY\\u2019S PRO FORMA PROFITABILITY IS NOT PROJECTED TO PRODUCE ADEQUATE RETURNS ON THE INVESTMENT COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK AND WE BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLE WE WILL CANCEL THE OPTION. SUCH WRITE-OFFS WERE LOCATED IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, AND IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS EXCEPT THE SOUTHEAST FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018. WE RECORDED $0.1 MILLION OF INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AND $1.1 MILLION AND $2.1 MILLION IN INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE DID NOT RECORD INVENTORY IMPAIRMENTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. THE IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THREE COMMUNITIES IN THE MID-ATLANTIC, SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST. THE IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THREE COMMUNITIES IN THE SOUTHEAST. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHETHER IMPAIRMENT LEVELS WILL REMAIN LOW. SHOULD WE DECIDE TO FURTHER LOWER PRICES OR HAVE FURTHER LAND SALES, OR SHOULD THE ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS USED IN DETERMINING ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS OR FAIR VALUE DECREASE OR DIFFER FROM CURRENT ESTIMATES IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY NEED TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENTS.  LAND SALES AND OTHER REVENUES.  LAND SALES AND OTHER REVENUES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF LAND AND LOT SALES. A BREAKOUT OF LAND AND LOT SALES IS SET FORTH BELOW.

ALTHOUGH WE BUDGET LAND SALES, THEY ARE OFTEN DEPENDENT UPON RECEIVING APPROVALS AND ENTITLEMENTS, THE TIMING OF WHICH CAN BE UNCERTAIN. AS A RESULT, PROJECTING THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF LAND SALES IS DIFFICULT. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH LAND SALES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO THE MIX OF LAND PARCELS SOLD. THERE WAS ONE LAND SALE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND NONE IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THERE WERE FIVE LAND SALES IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO TWO IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019 OCCURRED DESPITE THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LAND SALES, DEMONSTRATING THE IMPACT THE MIX OF LAND SALES CAN HAVE ON LAND SALE REVENUES.  LAND SALES AND OTHER REVENUES INCREASED $0.6 MILLION AND DECREASED $15.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OTHER REVENUES INCLUDE INCOME FROM CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS, WHERE THE DEPOSIT HAS BEEN FORFEITED DUE TO CONTRACT TERMINATIONS, INTEREST INCOME, CASH DISCOUNTS AND MISCELLANEOUS ONE-TIME RECEIPTS. FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, THE FLUCTUATION WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN LAND SALES REVENUES NOTED ABOVE. THE DECREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS ALSO PARTIALLY DUE TO THE $3.6 MILLION GAIN RECOGNIZED FROM THE SALE OF OUR FORMER CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HOMEBUILDING SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE OF JOINT VENTURE MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED OF $3.1 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH OFFSET GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS A RESULT OF LESS UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE DELIVERIES, AND AN ADJUSTMENT TO OUR INSURANCE RESERVES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 DUE TO A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT, WHICH REDUCED SGA COSTS BY $2.3 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. SGA EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOMEBUILDING REVENUES INCREASED TO 9.3% AND 10.3% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 8.5% AND 9.4% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  TOTAL SGA EXPENSES (INCLUDING CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES) PER OPEN FOR SALE COMMUNITY DECREASED FROM $439,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO $424,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AND DECREASED FROM $1,359,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO $1,318,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS A RESULT OF OUR INCREASED COMMUNITY COUNT. THESE DECREASES WERE THE RESULT OF OUR OPEN FOR SALE COMMUNITY COUNT INCREASING 12.2% AND 3.8% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS, WHILE OUR TOTAL SGA EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WERE ONLY UP 8.5% AND 0.7%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THIS EFFICIENCY IN SGA EXPENSES PER OPEN FOR SALE COMMUNITY IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF OUR STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR SGA EXPENSES RELATIVE TO TOTAL REVENUES AS HOME DELIVERIES BEGIN TO OCCUR FROM OUR INCREASED NUMBER OF NEWLY OPENED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT NEXT YEAR. AS WE START GETTING A GREATER NUMBER OF DELIVERIES FROM OUR GROWING COMMUNITY COUNT, WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE OUR COSTS AND IMPROVE OUR SGA EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.

THESE INSTRUMENTS INVOLVE, TO VARYING DEGREES, ELEMENTS OF CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MBS FORWARD COMMITMENTS AND LOAN SALES TRANSACTIONS IS MANAGED BY LIMITING OUR COUNTERPARTIES TO INVESTMENT BANKS, FEDERALLY REGULATED BANK AFFILIATES AND OTHER INVESTORS MEETING OUR CREDIT STANDARDS.

THE DECREASE IN INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS IS DUE TO CERTAIN OF OUR JOINT VENTURES DELIVERING LESS HOMES, RESULTING IN LOWER PROFITS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL THIRD QUARTER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS RECOGNIZING THE LOSS FROM WRITING DOWN THE INVESTMENT OF ONE OF OUR JOINT VENTURES WHERE THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE INVESTMENT IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE NINE MONTHS IS DUE TO OUR SHARE OF INCOME FROM CERTAIN OF OUR JOINT VENTURES DELIVERING MORE HOMES, RESULTING IN INCREASED PROFITS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR WHEN THEY REPORTED LOSSES PRIMARILY DUE TO STARTUP COSTS OR HAVING JUST BEGUN DELIVERING HOMES.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TOTAL TAXES  THE TOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $0.5 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION RECOGNIZED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AND $1.1 MILLION AND $1.7 MILLION RECOGNIZED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO STATE TAX EXPENSE FROM INCOME GENERATED THAT WAS NOT OFFSET BY TAX BENEFITS IN STATES WHERE WE FULLY RESERVE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES.  INFLATION  INFLATION HAS A LONG-TERM EFFECT, BECAUSE INCREASING COSTS OF LAND, MATERIALS AND LABOR RESULT IN INCREASING SALE PRICES OF OUR HOMES. IN GENERAL, THESE PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN COMMENSURATE WITH THE GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN OUR HOUSING MARKETS AND HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE SALE OF OUR HOMES. A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACED BY THE HOUSING INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS THAT RISING HOUSE CONSTRUCTION COSTS, INCLUDING LAND AND INTEREST COSTS, WILL SUBSTANTIALLY OUTPACE INCREASES IN THE INCOME OF POTENTIAL PURCHASERS AND THEREFORE LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE HOME SALE PRICES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  INFLATION HAS A LESSER SHORT-TERM EFFECT, BECAUSE WE GENERALLY NEGOTIATE FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS WITH MANY, BUT NOT ALL, OF OUR SUBCONTRACTORS AND MATERIAL SUPPLIERS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR HOMES. THESE PRICES USUALLY ARE APPLICABLE FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS OR FOR A TIME PERIOD OF BETWEEN THREE TO TWELVE MONTHS. CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 54.1% OF OUR HOMEBUILDING COST OF SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING DEVELOPER OF SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING SOLUTIONS FOR VIDEO THAT ENABLE HIGH-DEFINITION, OR HD, VIDEO CAPTURE, ANALYSIS, SHARING AND DISPLAY. A DEVICE THAT CAPTURES VIDEO INCLUDES FOUR PRIMARY COMPONENTS: A LENS, AN IMAGE SENSOR, A VIDEO PROCESSOR AND STORAGE MEMORY. THE VIDEO PROCESSOR CONVERTS RAW VIDEO INPUT INTO A FORMAT THAT CAN BE STORED AND DISTRIBUTED EFFICIENTLY AND, IN SOME CASES, ANALYZES THE VIDEO DATA TO AUTOMATE PROCESSES. WE COMBINE OUR PROCESSOR DESIGN CAPABILITIES WITH OUR EXPERTISE IN VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING, COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE EASILY SCALABLE ACROSS MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS AND ENABLE RAPID AND EFFICIENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR SYSTEM-ON-A-CHIP, OR SOC, DESIGNS FULLY INTEGRATE HD VIDEO PROCESSING, IMAGE PROCESSING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OR AI, COMPUTER VISION, OR CV, FUNCTIONALITY, AUDIO PROCESSING, AND SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ONTO A SINGLE CHIP, DELIVERING EXCEPTIONAL VIDEO AND IMAGE QUALITY AT HIGH COMPRESSION RATES, DIFFERENTIATED FUNCTIONALITY AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION.  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN EXPANDING OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY THAT WE BELIEVE COMPLEMENTS OUR IMAGE PROCESSING AND VIDEO COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY, AND BUILDS A FOUNDATION TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES IN AI AND CV APPLICATIONS FOR A VARIETY OF MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT ENHANCED COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITY IS CRITICAL BOTH TO OUR CURRENT VIDEO MARKETS, SUCH AS IP SECURITY CAMERA, AS WELL AS FUTURE MARKETS SUCH AS AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER, OR OEM, CAMERAS FOR ADVANCED DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS, OR ADAS, AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, AND ROBOTICS. OUR RECENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON CREATING ADVANCED COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE, LOW-POWER HARDWARE PLATFORMS TO ENHANCE PROCESSING ACCELERATION, WHICH WE REFER TO AS OUR CVFLOW ARCHITECTURE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY HIGHLY-OPTIMIZED AI COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY WITH OUR VIDEO PROCESSOR PROVIDES AN OPTIMIZED CV PLATFORM. IN 2017, WE INTRODUCED OUR FIRST COMPUTER VISION SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP, THE CV1 SOC. IN 2018, WE INTRODUCED THREE NEW COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOCS TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP INTELLIGENT CAMERA SYSTEMS FOR A VARIETY OF MARKETS AT DIFFERENT FEATURE LEVELS.  24  OUR REVENUE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN GENERATED PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF OUR SOC SOLUTIONS FOR INCORPORATION INTO SPECI  ALIZED VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES SUCH AS WEARABLE SPORTS CAMERAS, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET CAMERAS, IP SECURITY CAMERAS AND CAMERAS INCORPORATED INTO UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES, OR UAVS OR DRONES. OUR REVENUE FROM SEVERAL OF THESE MARKETS, HOWEVER, HAS R  ECENTLY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES.  AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH, IF ANY, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND WITHIN THE CAMERA MARKETS WITH OUR VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOC SOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE  PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY AND HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING CAMERA MARKETS, AS WELL AS EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMPARISON TO PRIOR PERIODS AS WE DE  VOTE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOLUTIONS WITH INCREASED FUNCTIONALITY, SUCH AS COMPUTER VISION CAPABILITIES, AND AS WE TARGET NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  WE SELL OUR SOC SOLUTIONS TO LEADING ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS, OR ODMS, AND OEMS GLOBALLY, AND IN THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET, WE ALSO SELL TO TIER-1 SUPPLIERS TO OEMS. WE REFER TO ODMS AND TIER-1 AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AS OUR CUSTOMERS AND OEMS AS OUR END CUSTOMERS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE INDICATED OR AS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES. IN THE CAMERA MARKET, OUR SOLUTIONS ENABLE THE CREATION OF HIGH-QUALITY VIDEO CONTENT IN WEARABLE CAMERAS, AUTOMOTIVE CAMERAS, INTERNET PROTOCOL, OR IP, SECURITY CAMERAS, FOR BOTH PROFESSIONAL USE AND HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING, UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE CAMERAS, ALSO REFERRED TO AS UAVS OR DRONES, AND VIRTUAL REALITY CAMERAS, ALSO REFERRED TO AS 360\\u00b0 CAMERAS. WE ALSO RECENTLY INTRODUCED, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS EMERGING MARKETS, SUCH AS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITIES FOR AI-ENABLED SECURITY CAMERAS, AI-BASED DRIVING APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-PARKING, DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEMS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR HD MAPPING SOLUTIONS, OEM AUTOMOTIVE ADAS APPLICATIONS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  OUR SALES CYCLES TYPICALLY REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF TIME AND A SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES BEFORE WE CAN REALIZE REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF OUR SOLUTIONS, IF ANY. OUR TYPICAL SALES CYCLE CONSISTS OF A MULTI-MONTH SALES AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INVOLVING OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 SYSTEM DESIGNERS AND MANAGEMENT ALONG WITH OUR SALES PERSONNEL AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS PROCESS CULMINATES IN A CUSTOMER\\u2019S DECISION TO USE OUR SOLUTIONS IN ITS SYSTEM, WHICH WE REFER TO AS A DESIGN WIN. OUR SALES EFFORTS ARE TYPICALLY DIRECTED TO THE OEM OF THE PRODUCT THAT WILL INCORPORATE OUR VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOLUTION, BUT THE EVENTUAL DESIGN AND INCORPORATION OF OUR SOC INTO THE PRODUCT MAY BE HANDLED BY AN ODM ON BEHALF OF THE OEM. IN SOME OF THE NEW MARKETS WE ARE ADDRESSING, SUCH AS AI-BASED AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS, IT MAY TAKE LONGER AND REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES TO SECURE DESIGN WINS THAN IN OUR TRADITIONAL MARKETS.  VOLUME PRODUCTION MAY BEGIN WITHIN SIX TO 18 MONTHS OR EVEN LONGER AFTER A DESIGN WIN, DEPENDING ON THE TARGETED MARKET, THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR CUSTOMER\\u2019S PRODUCT AND OTHER FACTORS UPON WHICH WE MAY HAVE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE. ONCE ONE OF OUR SOLUTIONS HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO A CUSTOMER\\u2019S DESIGN, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOLUTION IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A COMPONENT OF THE CUSTOMER\\u2019S PRODUCT FOR ITS LIFE CYCLE BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH REDESIGNING A PRODUCT OR SUBSTITUTING AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION. CONVERSELY, A DESIGN LOSS TO A COMPETITOR WILL LIKELY PRECLUDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GENERATE FUTURE REVENUE FROM SUCH CUSTOMER\\u2019S PRODUCT. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN A DESIGN WIN AND OUR SOC REMAINS A COMPONENT THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE OF A CUSTOMER\\u2019S PRODUCT, THE VOLUME AND TIMING OF ACTUAL SALES OF OUR SOCS TO THE CUSTOMER DEPEND UPON THE PRODUCTION, RELEASE AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THAT PRODUCT, NONE OF WHICH ARE WITHIN OUR CONTROL. A PORTABLE CONSUMER DEVICE TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF SIX TO 18 MONTHS, WHILE AN IP SECURITY CAMERA TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 12 TO 24 MONTHS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRODUCT LIFECYCLES WILL TYPICALLY BE LONGER THAN 24 MONTHS IN THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THESE MARKETS.  25  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND TRENDS  \\u2022  WE RECORDED REVENUE OF $56.4 MILLION AND $103.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THIS REPRESENTED DECREASES OF 9.7% AND 13.2% FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASES IN REVENUE WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS, INCLUDING SPORTS CAMERA, NON-SPORTS WEARABLE CAMERA, VIRTUAL REALITY, AND DRONE MARKETS. THE DECREASES WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRINCIPALLY THE VIDEO RECORDER MARKET, CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM A LARGE AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASED REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED REVENUE IN THE CONSUMER IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, LED BY HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING MARKET IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION.  IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE CHINA AND EUROPE REGIONS, AND INITIAL RAMPS OF OUR COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOLUTIONS IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. IN THE SPORTS CAMERA MARKET, INCORPORATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS INTO NEWLY LAUNCHED SPORTS CAMERA PRODUCTS FROM DAJIANG INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INC., OR DJI, PARTIALLY OFFSET REVENUE LOSS FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO GOPRO, INC. OR GOPRO.  \\u2022  WE RECORDED OPERATING LOSSES OF $10.4 MILLION AND $28.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO OPERATING LOSSES OF $6.7 MILLION AND $16.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASED OPERATING LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED, PRIMARILY IN SUPPORT OF NEW APPLICATIONS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOLUTIONS, BUT WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE RECOGNITION OF APPROXIMATELY $3.2 MILLION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GRANTS FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES RELATED PRIMARILY TO INCREASED ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT AND INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  \\u2022  WE GENERATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $13.4 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $7.0 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES AS A RESULT OF DECREASED REVENUE AND INCREASED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LARGER NET LOSS, INCREASED NON-CASH EXPENSES, DECREASED CASH RECEIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND INCREASED PURCHASES OF OTHER ASSETS.  \\u2022  EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2019, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\\u201cASC\\u201d) TOPIC 842, LEASES. UNDER THIS NEW GUIDANCE, WE RECOGNIZE LEASES AS RIGHT-OF-USE (\\u201cROU\\u201d) ASSETS AND CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITIES AT THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS, WHILE RECOGNIZING LEASE EXPENSES UNDER STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD THROUGH THE LEASE TERM  . AS OF JULY 31, 2019, THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY $7.2 MILLION OF ROU ASSETS, NET OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND $7.4 MILLION OF LEASE LIABILITIES RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION OF LEASE EXPENSE, RESPECTIVELY, RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \\u2022  ON MAY 29, 2019, THE COMPANY\\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL REPURCHASE OF UP TO $50.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ORDINARY SHARES COMMENCING IMMEDIATELY THROUGH JUNE 30, 2020. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME-TO-TIME THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, 10B5-1 PLANS OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF ORDINARY SHARES, AND IT MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME AT THE COMPANY\\u2019S DISCRETION. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS FUNDED USING THE COMPANY\\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND ANY REPURCHASED SHARES ARE RECORDED AS AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES. THERE WERE NO SHARES REPURCHASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, $50.0 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASES THROUGH JUNE 30, 2020.  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR PERFORMANCE  ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON COMPUTER VISION TRENDS  . WE EXPECT THAT COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITY WILL BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT IN MANY OF OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE MARKETS, INCLUDING  IP SECURITY,  AUTOMOTIVE, ROBOTICS, AND UAV MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADVANCED AI COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY, ENABLE AND SUPPORT CUSTOMER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN EMERGING APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ADAS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, PEOPLE RECOGNITION, RETAIL ANALYTICS, AND MACHINE LEARNING, AND GAIN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND SOLUTIONS, WILL BE CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE SUCCESS. MOREOVER, ACHIEVING DESIGN WINS, PARTICULARLY FOR COMPUTER VISION-CENTRIC APPLICATIONS IN THE  IP SECURITY,  AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, IS VITAL TO OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE GROWTH. AS SUCH, WE CLOSELY MONITOR DESIGN WINS BY CUSTOMER AND END MARKET. HOWEVER, A DESIGN WIN MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY MATERIALIZE INTO REVENUE, AND EVEN IF IT DOES RESULT IN REVENUE, THE AMOUNT GENERATED BY EACH DESIGN WIN CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY.  26  PRICING, PRODUCT COST AND MARGIN  . OUR PRICING AND MARGINS DEPEND ON THE VOLUMES AND FEATURES OF THE SOLUTIONS WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW SOLUTIO  NS FOR BOTH COST IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES THAT WE EXPECT TO DRIVE REVENUE AND MAINTAIN MARGINS. IN GENERAL, SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED INTO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAMERA APPLICATIONS OR, IN THE FUTURE, ADVANCED  DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS, HAVE HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AS COMPARED TO SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO LOWER-PERFORMING, MORE COMPETITIVE CAMERA APPLICATIONS. OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICE CAN VARY BY MARKET AND APPLICATION DUE TO MARKET-SPECIFIC SUPPLY AN  D DEMAND, THE MATURATION OF PRODUCTS LAUNCHED IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS.  WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE COST OF OUR SOLUTIONS. AS WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAINTAIN A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR PRODUCTION YIELDS, COMPONENT COSTS AND DESIGN EFFICIENCIES.  SHIFTING CONSUMER PREFERENCES.  OUR REVENUE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONSUMER PREFERENCES, REGARDING FORM FACTOR AND FUNCTIONALITY, AND HOW THOSE PREFERENCES IMPACT THE VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE ELECTRONICS THAT WE SUPPORT. FOR EXAMPLE, IMPROVED SMARTPHONE VIDEO CAPTURE CAPABILITIES LED TO THE DECLINE OF VIDEO CAMERAS AIMED AT THE VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE MARKET. THE CURRENT VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE MARKET IS NOW CHARACTERIZED BY A GREATER VOLUME OF MORE SPECIALIZED VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE REPLACED WITH SMARTPHONES, SUCH AS WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE CAMERAS. THIS INCREASING SPECIALIZATION OF VIDEO CAPTURE DEVICES HAS CHANGED OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND END MARKETS AND HAS IMPACTED OUR REVENUE. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT FURTHER CHANGES WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN THOSE MARKETS.  CONTINUED CONCENTRATION OF REVENUE BY END MARKET  . HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF END MARKETS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2010, THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE CAME FROM THE POCKET VIDEO, CAMCORDER AND INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS. SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR NEW MARKETS AS THEY EMERGED, SUCH AS THE WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER CAMERA MARKETS. SINCE FISCAL YEAR 2013, THE WEARABLE SPORTS, PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY AND UAV MARKETS HAVE BEEN OUR LARGEST END MARKETS AND SALES INTO THESE MARKETS COLLECTIVELY GENERATED THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EXPANSION INTO NEW MARKETS IS REQUIRED TO FACILITATE REVENUE GROWTH AND CUSTOMER DIVERSIFICATION AS OUR REVENUE FROM THE WEARABLE CAMERA AND UAV CAMERA MARKETS HAS DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS EMERGING APPLICATIONS AND MARKETS, SUCH AS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITIES FOR AI-ENABLED SECURITY CAMERAS, AI-BASED DRIVING APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-PARKING, DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEMS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR HD MAPPING SOLUTIONS, OEM AUTOMOTIVE ADAS APPLICATIONS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS. WHILE WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO EXPAND OUR END MARKET EXPOSURE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF END MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR END MARKET CONCENTRATION MAY CAUSE OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF PRODUCTS THAT OUR SOCS ARE DESIGNED INTO AS WELL AS THE OVERALL GROWTH OR DECLINE IN THE VIDEO CAPTURE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF ODMS WHO BUILD PRODUCTS ON BEHALF OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEMS AND FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEMS TO WHOM WE SHIP DIRECTLY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON SALES TO A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS.  ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON CONNECTIVITY TRENDS  . MOBILE CONNECTED DEVICES ARE UBIQUITOUS TODAY AND PLAY AN INCREASINGLY PROMINENT ROLE IN CONSUMERS\\u2019 LIVES. THE CONSTANT CONNECTIVITY PROVIDED BY THESE DEVICES HAS CREATED A DEMAND FOR CONNECTED ELECTRONIC PERIPHERALS SUCH AS VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES. OUR ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE TRENDS BY SUPPORTING OUR END CUSTOMERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTED PERIPHERALS THAT SEAMLESSLY COOPERATE WITH OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES AND ALLOW CONSUMERS TO DISTRIBUTE AND SHARE VIDEO AND IMAGES WITH ONLINE MEDIA PLATFORMS IS CRITICAL FOR OUR SUCCESS. WE HAVE ADDED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONALITY INTO OUR SOLUTIONS FOR WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER CAMERAS. THE COMBINATION OF OUR COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY WITH WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY ENABLES WIRELESS VIDEO STREAMING AND UPLOADING OF VIDEOS AND IMAGES TO THE INTERNET. OUR SOLUTIONS ENABLE IP SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEMS TO STREAM VIDEO CONTENT TO EITHER CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE OR CONNECTED MOBILE DEVICES, AND OUR SOLUTIONS FOR WEARABLE AND UAV CAMERAS ALLOW CONSUMERS TO QUICKLY STREAM OR UPLOAD VIDEO AND IMAGES TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.  SALES VOLUME  . A TYPICAL DESIGN WIN THAT SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES INTO THE MARKETPLACE CAN GENERATE A WIDE RANGE OF SALES VOLUMES FOR OUR SOLUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE END MARKET DEMAND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 PRODUCTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY FORECAST DEMAND CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE REPUTATION OF THE END CUSTOMER, MARKET PENETRATION, PRODUCT CAPABILITIES, SIZE OF THE END MARKET THAT THE PRODUCT ADDRESSES, OUR END CUSTOMERS\\u2019 ABILITY TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS, MISCALCULATIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS OF THEIR INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR PRODUCT ORDER MIX AND FLUCTUATING DEMAND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 PRODUCTS. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE MAY PROVIDE VOLUME DISCOUNTS ON SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS, WHICH MAY BE OFFSET BY LOWER MANUFACTURING COSTS RELATED TO HIGHER VOLUMES. IN GENERAL, OUR CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER MARKET PENETRATION AND BETTER BRANDING TEND TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LARGER VOLUMES OVER THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE.  27  CUSTOMER PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE.  WE ESTIMATE OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES BASED ON THE CUSTOMER, TYPE  OF PRODUCT AND END MARKET. WE TYPICALLY COMMENCE COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS FROM SIX TO 18 MONTHS FOLLOWING A DESIGN WIN; HOWEVER, IN SOME MARKETS, MORE LENGTHY PRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLES ARE POSSIBLE, DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE PROJECT, SUCH  AS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM MARKET. A PORTABLE CONSUMER DEVICE TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF SIX TO 18 MONTHS, AND AN IP SECURITY CAMERA TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 12 TO 24 MONTHS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT LIFE CYC  LES WILL TYPICALLY BE LONGER THAN 24 MONTHS IN THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE, TIER-1 AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS TYPICALLY OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THESE MARKETS.

IN RECENT YEARS, OUR SOC SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY USED IN CAMERA MARKETS, SUCH AS IP SECURITY, AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER, DRONE AND WEARABLE CAMERAS. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THESE CAMERA MARKETS, IN PARTICULAR THE IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED NEW SOCS TARGETING EMERGING COMPUTER VISION APPLICATIONS IN THE IP SECURITY, OEM AUTOMOTIVE, AND ROBOTICS MARKETS. WE DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM SALES MADE INDIRECTLY THROUGH ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WINTECH MICROELECTRONICS CO., LTD., OR WINTECH, AND DIRECTLY TO ONE OF OUR ODM CUSTOMERS, CHICONY ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., OR CHICONY.  28  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY REVENUE WITH OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER NORMALLY BEING THE HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER. THIS FLUCTUATION HAS BEEN DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED SALES IN I  P SECURITY AND CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS AS OUR CUSTOMERS BUILD INVENTORIES IN PREPARATION FOR THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON. DUE TO  EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR OUR SOLUTIONS IN SEVERAL CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS, INCLUDING WEARABLE CAMERA, VIRTUAL REALITY  AND DRONE MARKETS  , THE SEASONAL IMPACT ON QUARTERLY REVENUE MAY NOT BE AS SIGNIFICANT AS IN PRIOR YEARS. MORE GENERALLY, OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE MIX OF OUR SOLUTIONS SOLD IN A PERIOD WHICH REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF BOTH CHANGES IN U  NIT SALES OF EXISTING SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION AND SALES OF NEW SOLUTIONS. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE TYPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY A LIFE CYCLE THAT BEGINS WITH HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER VOLUMES, FOLLOWED BY BROADER MARKET ADOPTION, HIGHER  VOLUMES AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAT ARE LOWER THAN INITIAL LEVELS.  THE END MARKETS INTO WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AS CONSUMER PREFERENCES HAVE EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPOSITION AND TIMING OF OUR REVENUE MAY DIFFER MEANINGFULLY DURING PERIODS OF TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCE CHANGES. WE EXPECT SHIFTS IN CONSUMER USE OF VIDEO CAPTURE TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AS COMPUTER VISION SPECIALIZED USE CASES EMERGE AND VIDEO CAPTURE CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE.  COST OF REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN  COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES THE COST OF MATERIALS SUCH AS WAFERS PROCESSED BY THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PACKAGING, ASSEMBLY AND TESTING, AND OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPORT OPERATIONS SUCH AS LOGISTICS, PLANNING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. COST OF REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES INDIRECT COSTS SUCH AS WARRANTY, INVENTORY VALUATION RESERVES AND OTHER GENERAL OVERHEAD COSTS.  WE EXPECT THAT OUR GROSS MARGIN MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, PRODUCT MIX AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED INTO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAMERAS, AND IN FUTURE ADVANCED AUTOMOTIVE OEM APPLICATIONS, HAVE HAD OR ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS, AS COMPARED TO SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO THE LOWER-PERFORMANCE, MORE COMPETITIVE CAMERA APPLICATIONS. AS SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS MATURE AND UNIT VOLUMES SOLD TO CUSTOMERS INCREASE, THEIR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES TYPICALLY DECLINE. THESE DECLINES MAY BE PAIRED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN MANUFACTURING YIELDS AND LOWER WAFER, PACKAGING AND TEST COSTS, WHICH OFFSET SOME OF THE MARGIN REDUCTION THAT COULD RESULT FROM LOWER SELLING PRICES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GROSS MARGIN WILL DECLINE IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO PENETRATE THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CAMERA MARKET AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE IP SECURITY MARKET.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS, INCLUDING SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH OUR FOUNDRY VENDORS, COSTS OF LICENSING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THIRD PARTIES FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT FOR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TOOLS, COST OF FABRICATION OF MASK SETS FOR PROTOTYPE PRODUCTS, AND ALLOCATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY EXPENSES, NET OF ANY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND OUR PRODUCT FEATURES AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASE HEADCOUNT FOR NEW SOC DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE MARKET.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS, INCLUDING SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FOR OUR SALES, MARKETING, FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. THE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES PROFESSIONAL SERVICE COSTS RELATED TO ACCOUNTING, TAX, LEGAL SERVICES, AND ALLOCATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY EXPENSES. WE EXPECT OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPAND THE SIZE OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OF ADDRESSING NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH OUR COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY.  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME, NET, CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME FROM DEBT SECURITY INVESTMENTS AND CASH DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  29  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  WE ARE INCORPORATED AND DOMICILED IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND ALSO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES, CHINA, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, ITALY, SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN, AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME IS SUBJECT TO VARYING TAX RATES, AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR EARNINGS OR LOSSES AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN EACH GEOGRAPHICAL REGION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION FROM CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; TAX BENEFITS FROM EXCESS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS; TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE TAX EFFECTS OF NONDEDUCTIBLE COMPENSATION. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AS A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS. IF OUR OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE WAS TO CHANGE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OPERATING INCOME SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN HIGHER-TAX JURISDICTIONS, OR IF WE WERE TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS ASSESSING RELATIVELY HIGHER TAX RATES, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND/OR BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR RESERVES ARE REASONABLE, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND ACCRUALS. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION RESERVES AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN DETERMINING ANY VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING PAST OPERATING RESULTS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. IN THE EVENT THAT WE CHANGE OUR DETERMINATION AS TO THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT CAN BE REALIZED, WE WILL ADJUST OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE WITH A CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

THE DECREASES WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRINCIPALLY THE VIDEO RECORDER MARKET, CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM A LARGE AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASED REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED REVENUE IN THE CONSUMER IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, LED BY HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING MARKET IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION.  IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE CHINA AND EUROPE REGIONS, AND INITIAL RAMPS OF OUR COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOLUTIONS IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASE IN THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. IN THE SPORTS CAMERA MARKET, INCORPORATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS INTO NEWLY LAUNCHED SPORTS CAMERA PRODUCTS FROM DAJIANG INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INC., OR DJI, PARTIALLY OFFSET REVENUE LOSS FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO GOPRO, INC.

THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF SOCS FOR THE IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKETS.  30  GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREA  SE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE THAT WAS DERIVED FROM THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKETS COMBINED WITH THE DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM THE HIGHER GROSS MARGIN SPORTS CAMERA, DRONE AND AUTOMOTIVE OEM MARKETS  . THE DECREASED GROSS MARGIN  WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO RISING TARIFFS THAT HAD GREAT IMPACT ON OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 ABILITY TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS INCORPORATING OUR HIGHER GROSS MARGIN DEVICES AND INCREASED COSTS TO ACCELERATE ORDERS AS A RESULT OF INCREASED GEOPOLITICAL CHALLENGES FROM OUR  SUPPLY-CHAIN.

THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALARY-RELATED AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED HEADCOUNT, ISSUANCE OF STOCK AND BONUS PROGRAM.  OUR ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT INCREASED TO 559 AT JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 547 AT JULY 31, 2018. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, SALARY-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE SOC DEVELOPMENT COST WAS RELATIVELY FLAT FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO THE TIMING AND NUMBER OF CHIPS IN DEVELOPMENT.

THE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LARGER INVESTED BALANCES, HIGHER INTEREST RATE AND DEBT SECURITIES PURCHASED AT DISCOUNTS.  31  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  CHANGE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  CHANGE  2019  2018  AMOUNT%  2019  2018  AMOUNT%  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  $1,978  $927  $1,051  113.4%  $3,244  $1,775  $1,469  82.8%  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  (24.1)%  (15.6)%  \\u2014  (8.5)%  (13.4)%  (11.7)%  \\u2014  (1.7)%  THE QUARTERLY INCOME TAXES REFLECT AN ESTIMATE OF THE CORRESPONDING FISCAL YEAR\\u2019S ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND INCLUDE, WHEN APPLICABLE, ADJUSTMENTS FROM DISCRETE TAX ITEMS ARISING IN THAT QUARTER.  THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NON-DEDUCTIBLE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF PROFITS GENERATED IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS AND LOSSES INCURRED IN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY WAS NOT ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A RELATED TAX BENEFIT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND JANUARY 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $375.8 MILLION AND $358.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  WE INVEST IN HIGHLY LIQUID, SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AND HOLD THESE INVESTMENTS AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.

THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LARGER NET LOSS, INCREASED NON-CASH EXPENSES, DECREASED CASH RECEIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND INCREASED PURCHASES OF OTHER ASSETS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN ADDITIONAL $57.1 MILLION IN CASH RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE AND MATURITY OF DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $51.5 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION SMALLER EXPENDITURE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.  32  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO $65.6 MILLION OF CASH USED FOR THE REPURCHASING OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 THAT WAS NOT INCURRED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CASH PROCEEDS FROM OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE WITHHOLDING. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION IN CASH FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS PURCHASED IN FISCAL YEAR 2020.  OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  AS OF JULY 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $375.8 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE AS WE INCREASE HEADCOUNT, EXPAND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AND IMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. AS WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY REQUIRE MORE WORKING CAPITAL. IF OUR AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY SEEK TO SELL EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR BORROW FUNDS COMMERCIALLY. THE SALE OF EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES MAY RESULT IN DILUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND THOSE SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, THESE SECURITIES COULD CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BEYOND OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED AMOUNTS. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON REASONABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL.  OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \\u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS;  \\u2022  OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR COSTS;  \\u2022  THE EXPANSION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS;  \\u2022  THE EMERGENCE OF COMPETING OR COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS;  \\u2022  THE COSTS OF FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING ANY PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PARTICIPATING IN LITIGATION-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND  \\u2022  OUR ACQUISITION OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES.

THIS INFORMATION INVOLVES RISKS AND  UNCERTAINTIES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE  RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SEE  \\u201cSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\\u201d AT  THE BEGINNING OF PART I, ITEM 1.  OVERVIEW  WE  MANUFACTURE AND SELL A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF INDUSTRIAL PROTECTIVE  CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES FOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND PUBLIC PROTECTIVE  CLOTHING MARKET. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD GLOBALLY BY OUR IN-HOUSE  SALES TEAMS, OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE GROUP, AND AUTHORIZED INDEPENDENT  SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO A NETWORK OF OVER 1,600 GLOBAL SAFETY  AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY DISTRIBUTORS. OUR AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTORS  SUPPLY END USERS, SUCH AS INTEGRATED OIL, CHEMICAL/PETROCHEMICAL,  AUTOMOBILE, STEEL, GLASS, CONSTRUCTION, SMELTING, HEAVY AND LIGHT  INDUSTRY, CLEANROOM, JANITORIAL, PHARMACEUTICAL, AND HIGH  TECHNOLOGY ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURERS, AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC,  MEDICAL LABORATORIES AND THE UTILITIES INDUSTRY. IN ADDITION, WE  SUPPLY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND  DEPARTMENTS, SUCH AS FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, AIRPORT CRASH RESCUE  UNITS, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND  SECURITY AND THE US FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. INTERNATIONALLY,  WE SELL TO A MIXTURE OF END USERS DIRECTLY, AND TO INDUSTRIAL  DISTRIBUTORS DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND MARKET. SALES  ARE MADE TO MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE INTO  CHINA, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (\\u201cEEC\\u201d), CANADA,  CHILE, ARGENTINA, RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN, COLOMBIA, MEXICO, ECUADOR,  INDIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA.  WE HAVE  OPERATED FACILITIES IN MEXICO SINCE 1995 AND IN CHINA SINCE 1996.  BEGINNING IN 1995, WE MOVED THE LABOR INTENSIVE SEWING OPERATION  FOR OUR LIMITED USE/DISPOSABLE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING LINES TO THESE  FACILITIES. OUR FACILITIES AND CAPABILITIES IN CHINA AND MEXICO  ALLOW ACCESS TO A LESS EXPENSIVE LABOR POOL THAN IS AVAILABLE IN  THE UNITED STATES AND PERMIT US TO PURCHASE CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS  AT A LOWER COST THAN THEY ARE AVAILABLE DOMESTICALLY. MORE RECENTLY  WE HAVE INITIATED STARTUP MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN VIETNAM AND  INDIA TO OFFSET INCREASING MANUFACTURING COSTS IN CHINA. THIS SHIFT  IN MANUFACTURING, AND THE REDUNDANT MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY IT  PROVIDES, ALSO SERVES TO INSULATE THE COMPANY FROM THE COST  IMPLICATIONS OF BILATERAL TRADE DISPUTES. OUR CHINA OPERATIONS WILL  CONTINUE OPERATIONS PRIMARILY MANUFACTURING FOR THE CHINESE MARKET  AND OTHER MARKETS WHERE DUTY ADVANTAGES EXIST. MANUFACTURING  EXPANSION IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY TO CONTROL RISING COSTS, IT IS ALSO  NECESSARY FOR LAKELAND TO ACHIEVE ITS GROWTH OBJECTIVES. OUR NET  SALES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE  $13.0 MILLION AND $12.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018 AND $24.9 AND $24.3 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES  GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES US TO MAKE  ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,  LIABILITIES, NET SALES AND EXPENSES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON THE PAST  EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE  REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE  THESE ESTIMATES.  WE  BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT OUR MORE  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR  UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL  OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM PRODUCT SALES, WHICH  CONSIST OF SALES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PERSONAL PROTECTIVE WEAR  PRODUCTS TO DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS PURCHASE ORDERS TO  BE A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER. CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS ARE  CONSIDERED TO BE SHORT-TERM WHEN THE TIME BETWEEN ORDER  CONFIRMATION AND SATISFACTION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IS  EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN ONE YEAR, AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE  COMPANY\\u2019S CONTRACTS ARE SHORT-TERM. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES  REVENUE FOR THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS TO CUSTOMERS IN AN  AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS  TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY  SATISFIES ITS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  UPON SHIPMENT OF THE GOODS. GENERALLY, PAYMENT IS DUE FROM  CUSTOMERS WITHIN 30 TO 90 DAYS OF THE INVOICE DATE, AND THE  CONTRACTS DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY  ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITIES AS A  FULFILLMENT COST RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTBOUND FREIGHT ARE  INCLUDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018 AND WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION AND $0.8 MILLION,  RESPECTIVELY, AND FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018  WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS RELATING TO PRODUCT SALES AND  REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM  REVENUE.  29  THE  TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION  RELATED TO REBATES, ALLOWANCES, AND DISCOUNTS THAT ARE REDUCTIONS  IN REVENUE. ALL ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL  EXPERIENCE, ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE, AND THE COMPANY'S BEST  JUDGMENT AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. ESTIMATES FOR VARIABLE  CONSIDERATION ARE REASSESSED EACH REPORTING PERIOD AND ARE INCLUDED  IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A  SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT  OCCUR UPON RESOLUTION OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLE  CONSIDERATION. ALL THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONTRACTS HAVE A SINGLE  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME AND THE  TRANSACTION PRICE IS STATED IN THE CONTRACT, USUALLY AS QUANTITY  TIME\\u2019S PRICE PER UNIT.  THE  COMPANY HAS SEVEN REVENUE GENERATING REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS  UNDER ASC TOPIC 280 \\u201cSEGMENT REPORTING\\u201d AND DERIVES ITS  SALES PRIMARILY FROM ITS LIMITED USE/DISPOSABLE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING  AND SECONDARILY FROM ITS SALES OF REFLECTIVE CLOTHING, HIGH-END  CHEMICAL PROTECTIVE SUITS, FIREFIGHTING AND HEAT PROTECTIVE  APPAREL, REUSABLE WOVEN GARMENTS AND GLOVES AND ARM GUARDS. THE  COMPANY BELIEVES DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION  BEST DEPICTS THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF ITS  REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS (SEE TABLE BELOW). NET SALES BY GEOGRAPHIC  REGION AND BY PRODUCT LINE ARE INCLUDED BELOW.

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE  STATED AT THE AMOUNT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COLLECT. THE COMPANY  MAINTAINS ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES  RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF ITS CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED  PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES LOSSES WHEN INFORMATION AVAILABLE  INDICATES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A RECEIVABLE HAS BEEN IMPAIRED  BASED ON CRITERIA NOTED BELOW AT THE DATE OF THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE  LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE  FOLLOWING FACTORS WHEN DETERMINING THE COLLECTABILITY OF SPECIFIC  CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS: CUSTOMER CREDITWORTHINESS, PAST TRANSACTION  HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC INDUSTRY TRENDS AND  CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PAYMENT TERMS. PAST DUE BALANCES OVER 90 DAYS  AND OTHER LESS CREDITWORTHY ACCOUNTS ARE REVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY FOR  COLLECTABILITY. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S  CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, ADVERSELY AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO  MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES WOULD BE REQUIRED. BASED ON  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR ESTIMATED  UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS THROUGH A CHARGE TO EARNINGS AND A CREDIT TO  A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. BALANCES THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING AFTER THE  COMPANY HAS USED REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS ARE WRITTEN OFF  THROUGH A CHARGE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND A CREDIT TO  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  30  INVENTORIES.  INVENTORIES INCLUDE FREIGHT-IN, MATERIALS,  LABOR AND OVERHEAD COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (ON A  FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS) OR NET REALIZED VALUE.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE  CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED WHEN EVENTS  OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE  RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY MEASURES ANY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT ON A  PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD. ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH  FLOWS REQUIRES THE COMPANY\\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE PROJECTIONS  THAT CAN DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THE CARRYING VALUE  OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE TOTAL  PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS  CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE  AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  LONG-LIVED ASSET.  INCOME TAXES.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE ITS INCOME  TAXES IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES AS PART OF  PREPARING THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS. THIS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE ACTUAL CURRENT TAX IN  ADDITION TO ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM  DIFFERING TREATMENTS FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.  THESE DIFFERENCES, TOGETHER WITH NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS  AND TAX CREDITS, ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE  SHEET. A JUDGMENT MUST THEN BE MADE OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ANY  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. A  VALUATION ALLOWANCE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. IN THE  EVENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL  OR PART OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET IN THE FUTURE, OR THAT NEW  ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT A PREVIOUSLY RECORDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE  IS NO LONGER REQUIRED, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS  CHARGED OR CREDITED TO INCOME IN THE PERIOD OF SUCH  DETERMINATION.  THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX POSITIONS THAT MEET A \\u201cMORE LIKELY  THAN NOT\\u201d MINIMUM RECOGNITION THRESHOLD. IF NECESSARY, THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX  MATTERS AS PART OF THE INCOME TAX PROVISION AND WOULD INCLUDE  ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES WITH THE RELATED TAX LIABILITY IN  THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY  DOES NOT HAVE ANY UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AT JULY 31, 2019 OR  JANUARY 31, 2019.  FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  . THE  COMPANY MAINTAINS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN THE PEOPLE\\u2019S  REPUBLIC OF CHINA, MEXICO, VIETNAM, INDIA, AND ARGENTINA AND CAN  ACCESS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CHINA, VIETNAM, ARGENTINA, AND  MEXICO. IT ALSO MAINTAINS SALES AND DISTRIBUTION ENTITIES LOCATED  IN CHINA, CANADA, THE U.K., CHILE, ARGENTINA, RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN,  INDIA, MEXICO, URUGUAY, AUSTRALIA, AND VIETNAM. THE COMPANY IS  VULNERABLE TO CURRENCY RISKS IN THESE COUNTRIES. THE FUNCTIONAL  CURRENCY FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM SUBSIDIARY IS THE EURO; THE TRADING  COMPANY IN CHINA, THE RMB; AND THE RUSSIAN OPERATION, THE RUSSIAN  RUBLE, AND THE KAZAKHSTAN OPERATION THE KAZAKHSTAN TENGE. ALL OTHER  OPERATIONS HAVE THE US DOLLAR AS ITS FUNCTIONAL  CURRENCY.  PURSUANT  TO US GAAP, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S FOREIGN  OPERATIONS WITH FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE US DOLLAR, ARE  TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE IN EFFECT AT THE BALANCE SHEET  DATE, WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES  PREVAILING DURING THE PERIODS. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED  IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS, A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF  STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY. CASH FLOWS ARE ALSO TRANSLATED AT  AVERAGE TRANSLATION RATES FOR THE PERIODS, THEREFORE AMOUNTS  REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS WILL NOT  NECESSARILY AGREE WITH CHANGES IN THE CORRESPONDING BALANCES ON THE  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARISE  FROM EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN A  CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN THE  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  US GAAP DEFINES FAIR  VALUE, PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE AND REQUIRES  CERTAIN DISCLOSURES UTILIZING A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH IS  CATEGORIZED INTO THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION  TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF  DESCRIPTION OF THOSE THREE LEVELS.  31  LEVEL  1.  OBSERVABLE INPUTS  SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL  ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL  2.  INPUTS OTHER THAN  QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY,  EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THESE INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR  SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND QUOTED PRICES  FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE  NOT ACTIVE.  LEVEL  3.  UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS  THAT REFLECT MANAGEMENT\\u2019S OWN ASSUMPTIONS.  THE  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS  OR LIABILITIES, INCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE, SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, BORROWINGS UNDER REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, ARE  RECORDED AT CARRYING VALUE, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON  THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.  THE  COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE FAIR VALUES OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT  APPROXIMATES ITS CARRYING VALUE BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST  RATE COMPARED TO THE CURRENT MARKET RATE AVAILABLE TO THE  COMPANY.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE  NOTE 3 IN THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S PERIODIC REVIEW OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  THAT WERE ISSUED.  SIGNIFICANT BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATION JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO  JANUARY 31, 2019  BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS.  CASH DECREASED BY $3.8 MILLION,  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A NET INCREASE IN OTHER WORKING CAPITAL  ELEMENTS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED $1.5 MILLION AND INVENTORY  INCREASED BY $7.0 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019.  THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN  SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN  INVENTORY WAS DUE TO THE SCALE UP OF OUR VIETNAM OPERATIONS; RAW  MATERIALS AND FINISHED GOODS (\\\"FG\\\") TO CATCH UP ON REMAINING  GLOVES, FIRE, AND HIGH VISABILITY ORDERS DELAYED DUE TO OUR ERP  INSTALLATION AND RAW MATERIALS AND FG REQUIRED TO RAMP UP PRODUCT  OF OUR NEW, HIGH VALUE UTILITIES PRODUCT LINE AT A MAJOR  DISTRIBUTOR. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED COMPENSATION, AND OTHER  ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED $3.4 MILLION DUE TO INCREASED INVENTORY  AND INCREASED COMPENSATION ACCRUALS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF PAY  DATES AND SEVERANCE.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED JULY 31, 2018  NET SALES.  NET SALES  INCREASED TO $27.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019  COMPARED TO $25.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018,  AN INCREASE OF 7.2%. SALES IN THE US WERE UP $1.1 MILLION OR 8.1%  PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED CUSTOMER DELIVERIES ENABLING US TO REDUCE  HIGH ORDER BACKLOGS. NO OTHER REGION HAD A MATERIAL CHANGE DURING  THE PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS  PROFIT INCREASED $1.3 MILLION, OR 13.9%, TO $10.4 MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, FROM $9.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET  SALES INCREASED TO 37.9% FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31,  2019, FROM 35.7% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. MAJOR  FACTORS DRIVING GROSS MARGINS WERE.  \\u25cf  INCREASED SALES OF  HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCT LINES, PRIMARILY DIPOSABLES, CHEMICAL, AND  FIRE.  \\u25cf  REDUCTION IN  FREIGHT COSTS DUE TO IMPROVED CONTROLS OVER LOGISTICS.  \\u25cf  IMPROVED  MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY IN VIETNAM.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED 3.7% FROM  $7.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 TO $7.8  MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019. OPERATING  EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 28.3% FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, FROM 29.3% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED LEGAL AND  PROFESSIONAL FEES, COMPENSATION (INCLUDING SEVERANCE), AND  DEPRECIATION, OFFSET BY DECREASES IN BAD DEBT EXPENSES, AND  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED  PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCED NUMBER OF SHARES EXPECTED TO BE EARNED  UNDER THE PERFORMANCE PLAN.  32  OPERATING PROFIT  . OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED TO $2.6 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $1.6 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, DUE TO THE IMPACTS  DETAILED ABOVE. OPERATING MARGINS WERE 9.6% FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO 6.4% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE  . INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $0.04 MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, THE SAME AS THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED JULY 31, 2018 AS A RESULT OF VERY LITTLE BORROWINGS DURING  EACH PERIOD.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  .  INCOME TAX EXPENSE CONSISTS OF  FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES. INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS  $1.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO  $0.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, DUE TO AN  INCREASE IN OPERATING PROFIT AND AN INCREASE IN THE OVERALL  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO AN INCREASED PROVISION OF $0.2 MILLION  FOR THE REMEASUREMENT AND REASSESSMENT OF THE GILTI TAX  IMPACT.  NET INCOME.  NET INCOME WAS $1.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $1.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2018  NET SALES.  NET SALES  INCREASED TO $52.2 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019  COMPARED TO $50.0 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018,  AN INCREASE OF 4.4%. SALES IN THE US WERE UP $1.6 MILLION OR 6.2%  PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED CUSTOMER DELIVERIES ENABLING US TO REDUCE  HIGH ORDER BACKLOGS CARRIED OVER FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019. NO OTHER REGION HAD A MATERIAL CHANGE DURING THE  PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS  PROFIT DECREASED $0.7 MILLION, OR 3.7%, TO $18.0 MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, FROM $18.7 MILLION FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET  SALES DECREASED TO 34.5% FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31,  2019, FROM 37.3% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. GROSS  PROFITS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 WERE ADVERSELY  EFFECTED BY INEFFICIENCIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF THE PERIOD  DUE TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S RECENT CONVERSION TO AN ERP SOFTWARE  SYSTEM. THOSE INEFFICIENCIES RESULTED IN INCREASED FREIGHT AND  LABOR EXPENSES REQUIRED TO EXPEDITE SHIPMENTS OF MATERIALS AND  CUSTOMER ORDERS. WHILE MANY OF THESE ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM  IMPLEMENTATION HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND THE COMPANY BEGAN TO REALIZE  THE RESULTING BENEFITS IN THE LAST PART OF THE PERIOD, REMEDIATION  ACTIVITIES ARE CONTINUING AND WE EXPECT SUCH ADVERSE EFFECTS TO  CONTINUE LESSENING, AND ULTIMATELY YIELD IMPROVED FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED 7.2% TO  $15.7 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 FROM $14.6  MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. OPERATING EXPENSES  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 30.0% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019 UP FROM 29.3% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.  OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL COSTS INCURRED FOR THE  CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ERP SYSTEM THAT HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED  IN THE GROSS PROFIT SECTION ABOVE. OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO  THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE INCREASES IN LEGAL FEES,  COMPENSATION (INCLUDING SEVERANCE), AND DEPRECIATION OFFSET BY A  DECREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCED NUMBER OF  SHARES EXPECTED TO BE EARNED UNDER THE PERFORMANCE  PLAN.  OPERATING PROFIT  . OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED TO $2.3  MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 FROM OF $4.1 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, DUE TO THE IMPACTS DETAILED  ABOVE. OPERATING MARGINS WERE 4.5% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY  31, 2019, COMPARED TO 8.1% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31,  2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE  . INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $0.07 MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, THE SAME AS THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2018 AS A RESULT OF VERY LITTLE BORROWINGS FOR EACH  QUARTER  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  .  INCOME TAX EXPENSE CONSISTS OF  FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES. INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS  $1.3 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO  $1.1 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE  TAX RATE FOR THE PERIOD WAS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO RATE  DIFFERENCES IN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND AN INCREASED PROVISION  OF $0.3 MILLION DUE TO THE REMEASUREMENT AND REASSESSMENT OF THE  GILTI TAX IMPACT.  33  NET INCOME.  NET INCOME WAS $0.9 MILLION FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $2.9 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018. THE RESULTS FOR SIX MONTHS  ENDED JULY 31, 2019 ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTION IN GROSS PROFIT  AND THE INCREASE OF OPERATING EXPENSES.

FACILITIES MAINTENANCE DISTRIBUTES MRO PRODUCTS, PROVIDES VALUE-ADD SERVICES AND FABRICATES CUSTOM PRODUCTS. THE INDUSTRIES THAT FACILITIES MAINTENANCE SERVES INCLUDE MULTIFAMILY, HOSPITALITY, HEALTHCARE AND INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES. PRODUCTS INCLUDE ELECTRICAL AND LIGHTING ITEMS, PLUMBING, HVAC PRODUCTS, APPLIANCES, JANITORIAL SUPPLIES, HARDWARE, KITCHEN AND BATH CABINETS, WINDOW COVERINGS, TEXTILES AND GUEST AMENITIES, HEALTHCARE MAINTENANCE AND WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PRODUCTS.  \\u200b  CONSTRUCTION & INDUSTRIAL.

CORPORATE INCURS COSTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S CENTRALIZED SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF FINANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL, SUPPLY CHAIN AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES. ALL CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. ELIMINATIONS INCLUDE THE ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.  \\u200b  ACQUISITIONS  \\u200b  WE ENTER INTO STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS FROM TIME TO TIME TO EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS, NEW PLATFORMS, AND NEW GEOGRAPHIES IN AN EFFORT TO BETTER SERVICE EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACT NEW ONES.

HARRIS CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES (\\u201cA.H. HARRIS\\u201d) FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $359 MILLION IN CASH, ADJUSTED FOR THE FINAL WORKING CAPITAL SETTLEMENT RECEIVED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER 2019\\u201d). A.H. HARRIS IS A LEADING SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION DISTRIBUTOR SERVING THE NORTHEAST AND MID-ATLANTIC REGIONS. THIS ACQUISITION EXPANDS CONSTRUCTION & INDUSTRIAL\\u2019S MARKET PRESENCE IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF A.H. HARRIS, SEE \\u201cNOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS,\\u201d IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITHIN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  \\u200b  SEASONALITY  \\u200b  IN A TYPICAL YEAR, OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY SEASONALITY. HISTORICALLY, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR DUE TO FAVORABLE WEATHER AND LONGER DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS DURING THESE PERIODS. SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS MAY ALSO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS, SUCH AS COLD OR WET WEATHER, WHICH CAN DELAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.  \\u200b  FISCAL YEAR  \\u200b  HD SUPPLY\\u2019S FISCAL YEAR IS A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SUNDAY NEAREST TO JANUARY 31.  THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 2, 2020 (\\u201cFISCAL 2019\\u201d) INCLUDES 52 WEEKS AND THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2019 (\\u201cFISCAL 2018\\u201d) INCLUDED 53 WEEKS.  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER 2019\\u201d) AND JULY 29, 2018 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER 2018\\u201d) BOTH INCLUDE 13 WEEKS. THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 AND JULY 29, 2018 BOTH INCLUDE 26 WEEKS.  KEY BUSINESS METRICS  \\u200b  NET SALES  \\u200b  WE EARN OUR NET SALES PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OPERATIONS, AND RENOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT-RELATED PRODUCTS AND OUR PROVISION OF RELATED SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY 500,000 CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CONTRACTORS, GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, MAINTENANCE PROFESSIONALS, HOME BUILDERS AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. WE RECOGNIZE SALES, NET OF SALES TAX AND ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS AND DISCOUNTS, WHEN AN IDENTIFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED BY TRANSFER OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER. NET SALES IN CERTAIN BUSINESS UNITS FLUCTUATE WITH THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES AS WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING COMMODITIES PRICES BY PASSING SUCH INCREASES IN THE PRICES OF CERTAIN COMMODITY-BASED PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  \\u200b  WE SHIP PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS BY INTERNAL FLEET AND BY THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS. NET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED FROM PRODUCT SALES WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH GENERALLY OCCURS AT THE POINT OF DESTINATION.  \\u200b  WE INCLUDE SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN NET SALES. SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INBOUND FREIGHT ARE CAPITALIZED TO INVENTORIES AND RELIEVED THROUGH COST OF SALES AS INVENTORIES ARE SOLD. WE ACCOUNT FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTBOUND FREIGHT AS A FULFILLMENT COST. SUCH COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  \\u200b  GROSS PROFIT  \\u200b  GROSS PROFIT PRIMARILY REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRODUCT COST FROM OUR SUPPLIERS (NET OF EARNED REBATES AND DISCOUNTS), INCLUDING THE COST OF INBOUND FREIGHT, AND THE SALE PRICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THE COST OF OUTBOUND FREIGHT, PURCHASING, RECEIVING AND WAREHOUSING ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WITHIN OPERATING EXPENSES. OUR GROSS PROFIT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER COMPANIES, AS OTHER COMPANIES MAY INCLUDE ALL OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS IN COST OF SALES.  \\u200b  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  HD SUPPLY  \\u200b  OPERATING EXPENSES  \\u200b  OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE PAYROLL EXPENSES (SALARIES, WAGES, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, PAYROLL TAXES AND BONUSES), OUTBOUND FREIGHT, RENT, INSURANCE, UTILITIES, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE AND PROFESSIONAL FEES. IN ADDITION, OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME  \\u200b  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME ARE NOT RECOGNIZED TERMS UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) AND DO NOT PURPORT TO BE ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE PRESENT ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME BECAUSE EACH IS A PRIMARY MEASURE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT ADJUSTED NET INCOME TO MEASURE OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY AS WE BELIEVE IT IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME ENHANCES OUR INVESTORS\\u2019 OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME ARE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING OPERATING TRENDS, BECAUSE EACH EXCLUDES THE RESULTS OF DECISIONS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF OPERATING MANAGEMENT AND THAT CAN DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM COMPANY TO COMPANY DEPENDING ON LONG-TERM STRATEGIC DECISIONS REGARDING CAPITAL STRUCTURE, THE TAX JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH COMPANIES OPERATE, AGE AND BOOK DEPRECIATION OF FACILITIES AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  \\u200b  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS BASED ON \\u2018\\u2018CONSOLIDATED EBITDA,\\u2019\\u2019 A MEASURE WHICH IS DEFINED IN OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES AND USED IN CALCULATING FINANCIAL RATIOS IN SEVERAL MATERIAL DEBT COVENANTS. BORROWINGS UNDER THESE FACILITIES ARE A KEY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY AND OUR ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THESE FACILITIES DEPENDS UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH FINANCIAL RATIO COVENANTS. IN PARTICULAR, BOTH FACILITIES CONTAIN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT CAN RESTRICT OUR ACTIVITIES IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN FINANCIAL RATIOS CALCULATED BASED ON CONSOLIDATED EBITDA. OUR SENIOR ABL FACILITY REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1:1 IF OUR SPECIFIED EXCESS AVAILABILITY (INCLUDING AN AMOUNT BY WHICH OUR BORROWING BASE EXCEEDS THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS) UNDER THE SENIOR ABL FACILITY FALLS BELOW THE GREATER OF $100 MILLION AND 10% OF THE LESSER OF (A) THE BORROWING BASE AND (B) THE TOTAL FACILITY COMMITMENT (BOTH AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR ABL FACILITY AGREEMENT). ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME (LOSS) LESS INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, PLUS (I) INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME, NET, (II) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, (III) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND FURTHER ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, NON-CASH ITEMS AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL STRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS PERMITTED IN CALCULATING CONSOLIDATED EBITDA UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING ADJUSTED EBITDA IS APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS ABOUT HOW THE COVENANTS IN THOSE AGREEMENTS OPERATE AND ABOUT CERTAIN NON-CASH AND OTHER ITEMS. THE TERM LOAN FACILITY AND SENIOR ABL FACILITY PERMIT US TO MAKE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN CALCULATING CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, SUCH AS PROJECTED NET COST SAVINGS, WHICH ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ADJUSTED EBITDA DATA PRESENTED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE REFLECT SUCH PERMITTED ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR CALCULATIONS OF ADJUSTED EBITDA. THESE COVENANTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY AS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS WOULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES. THE MATERIAL COVENANTS IN OUR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2019.  \\u200b  ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME LESS INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, FURTHER ADJUSTED FOR LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT AND CERTAIN NON-CASH, NON-RECURRING, NON-OPERATIONAL, OR UNUSUAL ITEMS, NET OF TAX.  \\u200b  WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES IN THEIR EVALUATION OF COMPANIES, MANY OF WHICH PRESENT AN ADJUSTED EBITDA OR ADJUSTED NET INCOME MEASURE WHEN REPORTING THEIR RESULTS. WE COMPENSATE FOR THE LIMITATIONS OF USING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BY USING THEM TO SUPPLEMENT GAAP RESULTS TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING THE BUSINESS THAN GAAP RESULTS ALONE. BECAUSE NOT ALL COMPANIES USE IDENTICAL CALCULATIONS, OUR PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.  \\u200b  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  HD SUPPLY  \\u200b  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME HAVE LIMITATIONS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS SUBSTITUTES FOR ANALYZING OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. SOME OF THESE LIMITATIONS ARE.  \\u25cf  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME DO NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN, OR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR, OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS;  \\u25cf  ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT OUR INTEREST EXPENSE, OR THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO SERVICE INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT;  \\u25cf  ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSES OR THE CASH REQUIREMENTS TO PAY OUR TAXES;  \\u25cf  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME DO NOT REFLECT HISTORICAL CASH EXPENDITURES OR FUTURE REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS; AND  \\u25cf  ALTHOUGH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION CHARGES ARE NON-CASH CHARGES, THE ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED WILL OFTEN HAVE TO BE REPLACED IN THE FUTURE, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT ANY CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH REPLACEMENTS.

THE DECREASE IN BOTH PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LOWER NON-CASH AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS AS A RESULT OF REFINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2018.  \\u200b  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  \\u200b  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DURING THE PERIOD IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL TAX RATE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR TO PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE REPORTED PERIOD PLUS OR MINUS UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT DISCRETE ITEMS OCCURRING WITHIN THE PERIOD. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN SECOND QUARTER 2019 WAS $48 MILLION COMPARED TO $46 MILLION IN SECOND QUARTER 2018.

THE DECREASE IN SECOND QUARTER 2019 WAS DUE TO THE INVESTMENT IN GROWTH INITIATIVES OUTPACING SALES GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS MARGIN.

REBAR COSTS BEGAN TO STABILIZE AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON GROSS MARGINS BEGAN TO SUBSIDE DURING SECOND QUARTER 2019.

FIRST, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW RH PROTOTYPE DESIGN GALLERY THAT IS AN INNOVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE BLUEPRINT WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL ENABLE US TO MORE QUICKLY PLACE OUR DISRUPTIVE PRODUCT ASSORTMENT AND IMMERSIVE RETAIL EXPERIENCE INTO THE MARKET. THE NEW MODEL IS A STANDARD WE WILL UTILIZE IN THE FUTURE THAT IS BASED ON KEY LEARNINGS FROM OUR RECENT GALLERY OPENINGS AND WILL RANGE IN SIZE FROM 33,000 LEASED SELLING SQUARE FEET INCLUSIVE OF OUR INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE TO 29,000 LEASED SELLING SQUARE FEET WITHOUT. THESE NEW GALLERIES WILL REPRESENT OUR ASSORTMENTS FROM RH INTERIORS, MODERN, BABY & CHILD, TEEN AND OUTDOOR AND CONTAIN INTERIOR DESIGN OFFICES AND PRESENTATION ROOMS WHERE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS CAN WORK WITH CLIENTS ON THEIR PROJECTS. DUE TO THE REDUCED SQUARE FOOTAGE COMPARED TO OUR RECENT DESIGN GALLERY OPENINGS AND EFFICIENT DESIGN, THIS NEW MODEL WILL BE MORE CAPITAL EFFICIENT WITH LESS TIME AND COST RISK, BUT YIELD SIMILAR PRODUCTIVITY. WE ANTICIPATE THE NEW PROTOTYPE DESIGN GALLERIES WILL REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF OUR TARGET MARKETS. FUTURE PROTOTYPE LOCATION EXAMPLES INCLUDE EDINA, MN, CORTE MADERA, CA, COLUMBUS, OH AND CHARLOTTE, NC.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SECOND, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND OPEN LARGER BESPOKE DESIGN GALLERIES IN THE TOP METROPOLITAN MARKETS, SIMILAR TO THOSE WE OPENED IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO. THESE ICONIC LOCATIONS ARE HIGHLY PROFITABLE STATEMENTS FOR OUR BRAND, AND WE BELIEVE THEY CREATE A LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DUPLICATE.  THIRD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO OPEN INDIGENOUS BESPOKE GALLERIES IN THE BEST SECOND HOME MARKETS WHERE THE WEALTHY AND AFFLUENT VISIT AND VACATION. THESE GALLERIES ARE TAILORED TO REFLECT THE LOCAL CULTURE AND ARE SIZED TO THE POTENTIAL OF EACH MARKET. EXAMPLES OF INDIGENOUS BESPOKE GALLERIES INCLUDE THE HAMPTONS, PALM BEACH, YOUNTVILLE AND ASPEN.  FOURTH, WE ARE DEVELOPING A NEW GALLERY MODEL TAILORED TO SECONDARY MARKETS. TARGETED TO BE 10,000 TO 18,000 SQUARE FEET, WE BELIEVE THESE SMALLER EXPRESSIONS OF OUR BRAND WILL ENABLE US TO GAIN SHARE IN MARKETS CURRENTLY ONLY SERVED BY SMALLER COMPETITORS. EXAMPLES OF TARGET SECONDARY MARKETS INCLUDE HARTFORD, CT, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK AND MILWAUKEE, WI, AMONG OTHERS. WE EXPECT THESE GALLERIES TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIALLY SMALLER NET INVESTMENT THAN OUR LARGER DESIGN GALLERIES AND TO PAY BACK OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT WITHIN TWO YEARS IN MOST INSTANCES. OUR PLAN IS TO TEST A FEW OF THESE GALLERIES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, AND IF PROVEN SUCCESSFUL, THIS FORMAT COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OUR LONG-TERM GALLERY TARGETS.  WE BELIEVE OUR MULTI-TIER MARKET APPROACH TO TRANSFORMING OUR REAL ESTATE WILL ENABLE US TO RAMP OUR OPENING CADENCE FROM 3 TO 5 NEW GALLERIES PER YEAR, TO A PACE OF 5 TO 7 NEW GALLERIES PER YEAR COMMENCING IN FISCAL 2020.  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR STANDALONE RH BABY & CHILD, RH TEEN AND RH MODERN GALLERIES IN SELECT MARKETS.  LIKE OUR EVOLVING MULTI-TIER MARKET APPROACH, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A MULTI-TIER REAL ESTATE STRATEGY THAT IS DESIGNED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR UNIT LEVEL PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. OUR THREE PRIMARY DEAL CONSTRUCTS ARE OUTLINED BELOW.  \\u25cf  FIRST,  DUE TO THE PRODUCTIVITY AND PROOF OF CONCEPT OF OUR RECENT NEW GALLERIES, AND THE ADDITION OF A POWERFUL, TRAFFIC-GENERATING HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE, WE ARE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE \\u201cCAPITAL LIGHT\\u201d LEASING DEALS, WHERE AS MUCH AS 65% TO 100% OF THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THE LANDLORD, VERSUS 35% TO 50% PREVIOUSLY.  \\u25cf  SECOND, IN SEVERAL OF OUR CURRENT PROJECTS, WE ARE MIGRATING FROM A LEASING TO A DEVELOPMENT MODEL. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO GALLERIES, YOUNTVILLE AND EDINA, USING THIS NEW MODEL, AND HAVE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE. IN THE CASE OF YOUNTVILLE AND EDINA, WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE A SALE-LEASEBACK THAT SHOULD ALLOW US TO RECOUP ALL OR A LARGE PORTION OF OUR CAPITAL. IN SOME CASES WE BELIEVE WE MAY BE ABLE TO PRE-SELL THE PROPERTY AND STRUCTURE THE TRANSACTION WHERE THE CAPITAL TO BUILD THE PROJECT IS ADVANCED BY THE BUYER DURING CONSTRUCTION, WHICH COULD REQUIRE ZERO UPFRONT CAPITAL FROM US.  \\u25cf  THIRD,  WE ARE WORKING ON JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS, WHERE WE SHARE THE UPSIDE OF A DEVELOPMENT WITH THE DEVELOPER/LANDLORD. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS NEW MODEL WOULD BE OUR FUTURE GALLERY AND GUESTHOUSE IN ASPEN, WHERE WE ARE CONTRIBUTING THE VALUE OF OUR LEASE TO THE DEVELOPMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A PROFITS INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DEVELOPER WILL DELIVER TO RH A SUBSTANTIALLY TURNKEY GALLERY AND GUESTHOUSE, WHILE WE CONTINUE TO RETAIN A 20% AND 25% PROFITS INTEREST IN THE PROPERTIES, RESPECTIVELY. WE WOULD EXPECT TO MONETIZE THE PROFITS INTEREST AT THE TIME OF SALE OF THE PROPERTIES DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. THE NET RESULT SHOULD BE A MINIMAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO OPERATIONALIZE THE BUSINESS, WITH THE EXPECTATION FOR A NET POSITIVE CAPITAL BENEFIT AT TIME OF MONETIZATION OF THE PROFITS INTEREST.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT ALL OF THE ABOVE DEAL STRUCTURES SHOULD LEAD TO LOWER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, HIGHER UNIT PROFITABILITY, AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL VERSUS OUR PRIOR GALLERY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \\u25cf  EXPAND OUR OFFERING AND INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE BY.  \\u25cf  TRANSFORMING OUR REAL ESTATE PLATFORM;  \\u25cf  GROWING OUR MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT AND INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND CATEGORIES;  \\u25cf  EXPANDING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING DESIGN SERVICES AND CAFES, WINE VAULTS AND COFFEE BARS AT OUR DESIGN GALLERIES;  \\u25cf  EXPLORING AND TESTING NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR CORE BUSINESS; AND  \\u25cf  INCREASING OUR BRAND AWARENESS AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY THROUGH OUR SOURCE BOOK CIRCULATION STRATEGY, MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM, OUR DIGITAL MARKETING INITIATIVES, ADVERTISING, AND PUBLIC RELATIONS ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS.  DURING FISCAL 2017 AND FISCAL 2018 WE DEFERRED THE INTRODUCTION OF MAJOR NEW PRODUCT CATEGORY EXPANSIONS OTHER THAN THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF RH HOSPITALITY IN CONJUNCTION WITH NEW DESIGN GALLERIES. IN FISCAL 2019, WE HAVE RESUMED INTRODUCING EXPANSIONS IN OUR MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT INCLUDING A NUMBER OF NEW MERCHANDISE COLLECTIONS IN BOTH RH INTERIORS AND RH MODERN, AS WELL AS THE LAUNCH OF RH BEACH HOUSE IN THE SPRING AND RH SKI HOUSE IN THE FALL.  WE ALSO PLAN TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN RH INTERIOR DESIGN IN FISCAL 2019 WITH A GOAL OF BUILDING THE LEADING INTERIOR DESIGN FIRM IN NORTH AMERICA. WE BELIEVE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE OPPORTUNITY BY OFFERING WORLD CLASS DESIGN AND INSTALLATION SERVICES AS WE MOVE THE BRAND BEYOND CREATING AND SELLING PRODUCTS, TO CONCEPTUALIZING AND SELLING SPACES.  \\u25cf  ARCHITECT NEW OPERATING PLATFORM.  WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS ARCHITECTING A NEW OPERATING PLATFORM, INCLUSIVE OF TRANSITIONING FROM A PROMOTIONAL TO MEMBERSHIP MODEL, OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK REDESIGN, THE REDESIGN OF OUR REVERSE LOGISTICS AND OUTLET BUSINESS, AND THE RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF OUR HOME DELIVERY AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, WHICH ENABLES US TO DRIVE LOWER COSTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS, AND HIGHER EARNINGS AND INVENTORY TURNS. LOOKING FORWARD, WE EXPECT THIS MULTI-YEAR EFFORT TO RESULT IN A DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, CONTINUED MARGIN ENHANCEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  \\u25cf  GROW OUR INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE.  IN 2015 WE BEGAN TO INTRODUCE AN INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING CAFE\\u0301S, WINE VAULTS AND BARISTA BARS, INTO A NUMBER OF OUR NEW GALLERY LOCATIONS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR INITIAL HOSPITALITY OFFERING IN CHICAGO LED US TO BROADEN THIS INITIATIVE BY ADDING HOSPITALITY TO A NUMBER OF OUR OTHER NEW GALLERY LOCATIONS. WE BELIEVE THIS HAS CREATED A UNIQUE NEW RETAIL EXPERIENCE THAT CANNOT BE REPLICATED ONLINE, AND THAT THE ADDITION OF HOSPITALITY IS HELPING TO DRIVE INCREMENTAL SALES OF HOME FURNISHINGS IN THESE GALLERIES.  \\u25cf  PURSUE INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LUXURY BRAND POSITIONING AND UNIQUE AESTHETIC WILL HAVE STRONG INTERNATIONAL APPEAL. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THERE IS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RH BRAND TO EXPAND GLOBALLY AND ARE CURRENTLY EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DESIGN GALLERIES IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE.  BUSINESS INITIATIVES  WE ARE UNDERTAKING A LARGE NUMBER OF NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES IN SUPPORT OF OUR KEY VALUE DRIVING STRATEGIES. IN PARTICULAR, BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2016 AND CONTINUING THROUGH FISCAL 2019, WE HAVE PURSUED A RANGE OF STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \\u25cf  INTRODUCTION OF MEMBERSHIP MODEL.  IN MARCH 2016, WE INTRODUCED THE RH MEMBERS PROGRAM, AN EXCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP MODEL THAT REIMAGINES AND SIMPLIFIES THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. FOR AN ANNUAL FEE, THE RH MEMBERS PROGRAM PROVIDES A SET DISCOUNT EVERY DAY ACROSS ALL RH BRANDS IN ADDITION TO OTHER BENEFITS INCLUDING COMPLIMENTARY INTERIOR DESIGN SERVICES THROUGH THE RH INTERIOR DESIGN PROGRAM AND ELIGIBILITY FOR  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PREFERRED FINANCING PLANS ON THE RH CREDIT CARD, AMONG OTHERS. WE BELIEVE THAT TRANSITIONING OUR BUSINESS FROM A PROMOTIONAL TO MEMBERSHIP MODEL HAS ENHANCED OUR BRAND, SIMPLIFIED AND STREAMLINED OUR BUSINESS AS WELL AS ALLOWED US TO DEVELOP DEEPER CONNECTIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.  \\u25cf  WE BELIEVE THAT THE SHIFT TO A MEMBERSHIP MODEL HAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS. SPECIFICALLY, WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE BENEFITS INCLUDE.  IMPROVED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE  . OUR INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS CAN NOW WORK WITH CUSTOMERS BASED ON THEIR TIMELINE AND PROJECT DEADLINES, AS OPPOSED TO OUR PRIOR PROMOTIONAL CALENDAR. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL LEAD TO LARGER OVERALL SALES TRANSACTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER DESIGN PROJECTS.  LOWER CANCELLATIONS AND RETURNS  . AS A RESULT OF THE ELIMINATION OF TIME-LIMITED PROMOTIONAL EVENTS AND THE ASSOCIATED PRESSURE OF PLACING AN ORDER BEFORE A PROMOTION EXPIRES, WE BELIEVE THE SHIFT TO A MEMBERSHIP MODEL HAS ALSO RESULTED IN LOWER RATES OF CANCELLED ORDERS AND RETURNS.  IMPROVED OPERATIONAL COSTS  . THE VOLUME OF SALES, ORDERS AND SHIPMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS UNDER THE PRIOR PROMOTIONAL MODEL WAS CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE SPIKES IN CUSTOMER ORDERS BASED UPON PROMOTIONAL EVENTS FOLLOWED BY LOWER ORDERS AND SALES AFTER THE END OF AN EVENT. THIS BUYING PATTERN ALSO AFFECTED NUMEROUS OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING STAFFING AND COSTS AS WE REQUIRED ELEVATED STAFFING LEVELS TO SERVICE THE INCREASED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS DURING PEAK SALES EVENTS. LIKEWISE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN SALES HAD DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR SUPPLY CHAIN RELATED TO MERCHANDISE ORDERS, MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION, SHIPMENT TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND FINAL DELIVERY TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ALL OF THESE ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE EXPERIENCING IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES AS A RESULT OF THE MEMBERSHIP MODEL WHEREBY SALES ARE MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS OPPOSED TO THE PEAKS AND VALLEYS OF ORDERS AND SALES UNDER THE PRIOR MODEL.  \\u25cf  DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK REDESIGN.  AS A RESULT OF OUR WORK TO REDESIGN OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND OPTIMIZE INVENTORY, IN FISCAL 2017 WE WERE ABLE TO FOREGO BUILDING A FIFTH FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTER PLANNED TO OPEN AND CONSOLIDATE OUR CURRENT FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTER NETWORK FROM FOUR PRIMARY LOCATIONS TO TWO PRIMARY LOCATIONS (NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND BALTIMORE, MARYLAND AREA). IN FISCAL 2017, WE COMPLETED THE CLOSURE OF OUR FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN LOS ANGELES AND DALLAS, ELIMINATING 1.75 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE, RESULTING IN SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF $20 MILLION ANNUALLY. IN FISCAL 2018, WE COMPLETED THE CLOSURE OF A SMALLER FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN ESSEX, MARYLAND, ELIMINATING 500,000 SQUARE FEET OF DISTRIBUTION CENTER SPACE, RESULTING IN SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF $5 MILLION ANNUALLY. WE BELIEVE MANAGING OUR BUSINESS IN FEWER FACILITIES WHILE DECREASING OUR ON-HAND INVENTORY WILL REDUCE FULFILLMENT COMPLEXITY, LOWER INVENTORY TRANSFER COSTS, INCREASE INVENTORY TURNS, IMPROVE WORKING CAPITAL AND SHOULD RESULT IN HIGHER GROSS MARGINS OVER TIME.  \\u25cf  RECONCEPTUALIZE REVERSE LOGISTICS BUSINESS.  IN FISCAL 2017, WE IMPLEMENTED INITIATIVES TO RE-CONCEPTUALIZE OUR OUTLET AND REVERSE LOGISTICS BUSINESS. PREVIOUSLY, RETURNS OF FURNITURE WOULD BE TRANSFERRED VIA OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS BACK TO A FURNITURE DISTRIBUTION CENTER, THEN EVENTUALLY TO ONE OF OUR OUTLET LOCATIONS. NOW, RETURNS OF FURNITURE ARE TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY FROM OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS TO OUTLETS, WHICH HAS REDUCED TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING COSTS, AND IMPROVED SELLING MARGINS ACROSS OUR OUTLET NETWORK. WE BELIEVE THIS INITIATIVE YIELDED SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS AND MARGIN ENHANCEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION ANNUALLY.  \\u25cf  LUXURY IN-HOME FURNITURE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE.  WE BELIEVE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE BY ENHANCING OUR APPROACH TO SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH IN-HOME DELIVERY. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE OUR LEVEL OF CONTROL AND IMPROVE SERVICES LEVELS OVER THE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE TO THE CUSTOMER\\u2019S RESIDENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO DEVELOP IMPROVED SOLUTIONS FOR IN-HOME DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER IN THE LUXURY MARKET. WE HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED A NUMBER OF SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE YIELDING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND REDUCTIONS IN PRODUCT RETURN AND EXCHANGE RATES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO OPTIMIZE OUR SERVICE OFFERING TO CUSTOMERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE IN-HOME DELIVERY EXPERIENCE AND ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD WILL CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL RESULTS.  \\u25cf  ELEVATE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE END-TO-END CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. AS WE HAVE ELEVATED OUR BRAND, ESPECIALLY AT RETAIL, WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO ENHANCE THE BRAND EXPERIENCE IN OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE MAKING CHANGES IN MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES THAT AFFECT OUR  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE IN-HOME DELIVERY EXPERIENCE, IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCT QUALITY AND ENHANCEMENTS IN SOURCING, PRODUCT AVAILABILITY, AND ALL ASPECTS OF CUSTOMER CARE AND SERVICE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF EXPERIENTIAL BRAND-ENHANCING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS EXPANDED DESIGN ATELIERS, THE RH INTERIOR DESIGN PROGRAM AND  THE LAUNCH OF  AN INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE IN A NUMBER OF OUR NEW GALLERIES,  WILL  FURTHER  ENHANCE  OUR CUSTOMERS\\u2019 IN-STORE EXPERIENCE, ALLOWING US TO FURTHER DISRUPT THE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED HOME FURNISHINGS LANDSCAPE AND ACHIEVE MARKET SHARE GAINS.  \\u200b  IN FISCAL 2017, FISCAL 2018 AND CONTINUING INTO FISCAL 2019, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATIONS AND CURRENT INITIATIVES ARE PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO OPTIMIZE THE ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING GENERATING FREE CASH FLOW AND OPTIMIZING OUR BALANCE SHEET, AS WELL AS DEPLOYING CAPITAL TO REPAY DEBT AND REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH WE BELIEVE CREATES A LONG-TERM BENEFIT TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE AND TEST NUMEROUS INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE MANY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDING THROUGH EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE INVENTORY, ELEVATE THE HOME DELIVERY EXPERIENCE, SIMPLIFY OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND IMPROVE OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN INCLUDING BY STREAMLINING AND REALIGNING OUR HOME OFFICE OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERING AND TRANSFORM OUR REAL ESTATE USING A RANGE OF DIFFERENT MODELS FOR SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF THE OPERATIONAL BENEFITS AND FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE STRATEGIC EFFORTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PURSUIT OF MULTIPLE INITIATIVES WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY RESULT IN PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN, AND INCREASED FLUCTUATION IN, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR COSTS AND EXPENSES IN THE SHORT TERM WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. DELAYS IN COMPLETION OF OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OR COSTS OVERRUNS COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION. FURTHER, MACROECONOMIC OR POLITICAL EVENTS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE OUR INITIATIVES OR THE SUCCESS OF SUCH INITIATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE TARIFFS IMPOSED TO DATE HAVE NOT HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR REVENUES, MARGINS AND EARNINGS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EXISTING TARIFFS AND THE ADDITIONAL TARRIFFS THAT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE, AS WELL AS OTHER FUTURE TARIFFS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED, WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION IN FUTURE TIME PERIODS. IN ADDITION, IN RECENT PERIODS THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AS WELL AS PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT DECLINE, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL HEALTH AND DEMAND LEVELS OF HIGH-END CONSUMERS, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER SUCH TRENDS WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. THE HOUSING MARKET IS AFFECTED BY A RANGE OF FACTORS INCLUDING HOME PRICES AND INTEREST RATES AND SLOWDOWNS IN THE HOUSING MARKET CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE HIGHER END HOUSING MARKET IN PARTICULAR MAY HAVE AN OUTSIZED INFLUENCE ON OUR LEVELS OF CONSUMER DEMAND SINCE OUR BUSINESS IS GEARED TOWARD THE HIGHER END OF THE HOME FURNISHINGS MARKET. THE ABOVE FACTORS AND OTHER CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES MAY CREATE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUES AND PROFIT IN THE NEAR TERM.  \\u200b  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  THREE MONTHS ENDED  \\u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED  \\u200b  \\u200b  AUGUST 3,  \\u200b  AUGUST 4,  \\u200b  AUGUST 3,  \\u200b  AUGUST 4,  \\u200b  2019  2018  2019  2018  \\u200b  \\u200b  (IN THOUSANDS)  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  NET REVENUES  \\u200b  $706,514  \\u200b  $640,798  \\u200b  $1,304,935  \\u200b  $1,198,204  COST OF GOODS SOLD  \\u200b  411,556  \\u200b  372,454  \\u200b  777,163  \\u200b  720,527  GROSS PROFIT  \\u200b  294,958  \\u200b  268,344  \\u200b  527,772  \\u200b  477,677  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  \\u200b  190,977  \\u200b  186,521  \\u200b  355,158  \\u200b  347,707  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  \\u200b  103,981  \\u200b  81,823  \\u200b  172,614  \\u200b  129,970  OTHER EXPENSES  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  INTEREST EXPENSE\\u2014NET  \\u200b  24,513  \\u200b  15,467  \\u200b  45,631  \\u200b  30,565  (GAIN) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT  \\u200b  (954)  \\u200b  917  \\u200b  (954)  \\u200b  917  TOTAL OTHER EXPENSES  \\u200b  23,559  \\u200b  16,384  \\u200b  44,677  \\u200b  31,482  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  \\u200b  80,422  \\u200b  65,439  \\u200b  127,937  \\u200b  98,488  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  \\u200b  16,665  \\u200b  2,533  \\u200b  28,458  \\u200b  10,121  NET INCOME  \\u200b  $63,757  \\u200b  $62,906  \\u200b  $99,479  \\u200b  $88,367  OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  ADJUSTED NET INCOME  (1)  \\u200b  $71,430  \\u200b  $54,509  \\u200b  $119,671  \\u200b  $87,161  ADJUSTED EBITDA  (2)  \\u200b  $133,716  \\u200b  $103,054  \\u200b  $234,101  \\u200b  $180,794  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \\u200b  $17,367  \\u200b  $25,657  \\u200b  $25,283  \\u200b  $42,916  LANDLORD ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION\\u2014NET OF TENANT ALLOWANCES  \\u200b  \\u200b  23,013  \\u200b  \\u200b  8,997  \\u200b  \\u200b  27,555  \\u200b  \\u200b  27,645  ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  (3)  \\u200b  $40,380  \\u200b  $34,654  \\u200b  $52,838  \\u200b  $70,561  \\u200b  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (1)  ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT IS NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d). WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME, ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN NON-RECURRING AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING PERFORMANCE. ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS INCLUDED IN THIS FILING BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTED NET INCOME PROVIDES MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND FACILITATES A MEANINGFUL EVALUATION OF OPERATING RESULTS ON A COMPARABLE BASIS WITH HISTORICAL RESULTS.

WE SEEK OUT AND EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EFFECTIVELY  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGING AND DEPLOYING CAPITAL IN WAYS THAT IMPROVE WORKING CAPITAL AND SUPPORT AND ENHANCE OUR BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND STRATEGIES. IN FISCAL 2017, WE COMPLETED TWO SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1 BILLION. A $300 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE WAS COMPLETED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017 AND A $700 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE WAS COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017. IN OCTOBER 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW $700 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OF WHICH $250 MILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES WERE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2018, AND THE $700 MILLION AUTHORIZATION AMOUNT WAS REPLENISHED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN MARCH 2019. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR AN AGGREGATE REPURCHASE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION, WITH $450 MILLION STILL AVAILABLE UNDER THE $700 MILLION REPURCHASE PROGRAM. REFER TO \\u201cSHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\\u201d BELOW. WE INTEND TO EVALUATE OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION FROM TIME TO TIME AND MAY ENGAGE IN FUTURE SHARE REPURCHASES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE BUYING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK REPRESENTS A GOOD VALUE AND PROVIDES A FAVORABLE RETURN FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE HAVE $635 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING, OF WHICH $300 MILLION MATURE IN JUNE 2020 AND $335 MILLION MATURE IN JUNE 2023. BASED ON ANTICIPATED STRONG CASH FLOW GENERATION IN 2019 AND BEYOND, WE EXPECT TO REPAY THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES AT MATURITY IN JUNE 2020 AND JUNE 2023 IN CASH TO MINIMIZE DILUTION. WHILE WE ANTICIPATE USING EXCESS CASH, FREE CASH FLOW AND BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT TO REPAY THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN CASH TO MINIMIZE DILUTION, WE MAY NEED TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY TO REPAY SUCH CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN CASH AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL TO FUND SUCH REPAYMENTS, OR THAT IF CAPITAL IS AVAILABLE THROUGH ADDITIONAL DEBT ISSUANCES OR REFINANCING OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES, THAT SUCH CAPITAL WILL BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US. WE BELIEVE THE STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE REDUCTION IN LEVERAGE WE HAVE ACHIEVED DURING THE PAST YEAR PUTS US IN A STRONG POSITION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CAPITAL MARKETS OPPORTUNISTICALLY. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MULTIPLE FINANCING ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO US ON FAVORABLE TERMS THAT COULD PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION.  WE EXTENDED AND AMENDED OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT IN JUNE 2017, WHICH HAS A TOTAL AVAILABILITY OF $600 MILLION, OF WHICH $10 MILLION IS AVAILABLE TO RESTORATION HARDWARE CANADA, INC., AND INCLUDES A $200 MILLION ACCORDION FEATURE UNDER WHICH THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT MAY BE EXPANDED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES FROM $600 MILLION TO UP TO $800 MILLION IF AND TO THE EXTENT THE LENDERS REVISE THEIR CREDIT COMMITMENTS TO ENCOMPASS A LARGER FACILITY. THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT HAS A MATURITY DATE OF JUNE 28, 2022.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ASSET BASED CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CAPITAL NEEDS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  OUR BUSINESS HAS RELIED ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, AS WELL AS BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE PURSUED IN THE PAST, AND MAY PURSUE IN THE FUTURE, ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FOR OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE STRATEGIC SALE OF ASSETS, UTILIZATION OF OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, AND ENTRY INTO NEW DEBT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS THAT PRESENT ATTRACTIVE TERMS.  WE MAY PURSUE STRATEGIES IN THE FUTURE, THROUGH THE USE OF EXISTING ASSETS AND DEBT FACILITIES, OR THROUGH THE PURSUIT OF NEW EXTERNAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS, TO FUND OUR STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE STOCKHOLDER VALUE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WHETHER RAISED THROUGH THE SALE OF ASSETS, UTILIZATION OF OUR EXISTING DEBT FINANCING SOURCES, OR PURSUIT OF ADDITIONAL DEBT FINANCING SOURCES, WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US ON A TIMELY MANNER, ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. TO THE EXTENT WE PURSUE ADDITIONAL DEBT AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, OUR CAPITALIZATION PROFILE MAY CHANGE AND MAY INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE, AND AS A RESULT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE FUTURE LIQUIDITY TO REPAY SUCH INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS WHICH AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND FUTURE USES OF CAPITAL.  IN ADDITION, OUR CAPITAL NEEDS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OR NEW OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CHOOSE TO PURSUE. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN REMODELING AND OPENING NEW DESIGN GALLERIES, AND THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE OPEN ADDITIONAL DESIGN GALLERIES, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO UNDERTAKE UPGRADES TO HISTORICAL BUILDINGS OR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW BUILDINGS.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCLUDE (I) CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND (II) CASH OUTFLOWS OF CAPITAL RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES TO DESIGN AND BUILD LANDLORD LEASED ASSETS, NET OF TENANT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED. WE ANTICIPATE OUR ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE $160 MILLION TO $170 MILLION IN FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR EFFORTS TO CONTINUE OUR GROWTH AND EXPANSION, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION OF NEW DESIGN GALLERIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR FISCAL 2019 ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS OF $50 MILLION TO $60 MILLION. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, ADJUSTED NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $52.8 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF CASH RECEIVED RELATED TO LANDLORD TENANT ALLOWANCES OF $15.7 MILLION.  CERTAIN LEASE ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRE THE LANDLORD TO FUND A PORTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION RELATED COSTS THROUGH PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO US. OTHER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS FOR OUR NEW DESIGN GALLERIES REQUIRE THE LANDLORD TO FUND A PORTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION RELATED COSTS DIRECTLY TO THIRD PARTIES, RATHER THAN THROUGH TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION ALLOWANCES AND ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE CONTRIBUTIONS DIRECTLY FROM OUR LANDLORDS RELATED TO THE BUILDING OF OUR DESIGN GALLERIES. AS WE DEVELOP NEW GALLERIES, AS WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN THE FUTURE LIKE OUR INTEGRATED HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCE, WE MAY EXPLORE OTHER MODELS FOR OUR REAL ESTATE, WHICH COULD INCLUDE LONGER LEASE TERMS OR FURTHER PURCHASES OF, OR JOINT VENTURES OR OTHER FORMS OF EQUITY OWNERSHIP IN, REAL ESTATE INTERESTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW SITES AND BUILDINGS. THESE APPROACHES MIGHT REQUIRE GREATER CAPITAL INVESTMENT ON OUR PART THAN A TRADITIONAL STORE LEASE WITH A LANDLORD. WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSITION OUR REAL ESTATE STRATEGY FROM A LEASING MODEL TO A DEVELOPMENT MODEL, WHERE WE POTENTIALLY BUY AND DEVELOP OUR DESIGN GALLERIES THEN RECOUP THE INVESTMENTS THROUGH A SALE LEASEBACK ARRANGEMENT RESULTING IN LOWER CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND LOWER RENT. IN THE EVENT THAT SUCH CAPITAL AND OTHER EXPENDITURES REQUIRE US TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN SECURING ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS OR AT ALL.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES, OR WILL BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FINANCING ON FAVORABLE TERMS TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO FUND ALL OF OUR INITIATIVES, OR THAT SUFFICIENT INCREMENTAL DEBT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US IN ORDER TO FUND OUR CASH PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE REPAYMENT OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $635 MILLION AT MATURITY OF SUCH SENIOR CONVERTIBLE NOTES. IN ADDITION, AGREEMENTS GOVERNING EXISTING OR NEW DEBT FACILITIES MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS IN THE MANNER WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OR TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING COMMITMENTS INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES IN CASH UPON MATURITY OF SUCH SENIOR NOTES. TO THE EXTENT WE NEED TO SEEK WAIVERS FROM ANY PROVIDER OF DEBT FINANCING, OR WE FAIL TO OBSERVE THE COVENANTS OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF EXISTING OR NEW DEBT FACILITIES, ANY SUCH EVENT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS INCLUDING TRIGGERING CROSS DEFAULTS OR OTHER CONSEQUENCES WITH RESPECT TO OTHER INDEBTEDNESS. OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS, AND ANY ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS THAT WE MAY INCUR, EXPOSES US TO CERTAIN RISKS WITH REGARDS TO INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND FLUCTUATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS OR TO REFINANCE ANY OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO MANAGE SUCH INTEREST RATES MAY BE LIMITED OR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, MACROECONOMIC TRENDS AND OTHER RISKS.  ANY WEAKENING OF, OR OTHER ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN, THE U.S. OR GLOBAL CREDIT MARKETS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS FUTURE DEBT. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE NECESSARY FUNDS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, OR THAT FUTURE FINANCING REQUIREMENTS WOULD NOT REQUIRE US TO RAISE MONEY THROUGH AN EQUITY FINANCING OR BY OTHER MEANS THAT COULD BE DILUTIVE TO HOLDERS OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK. IF WE FAIL TO RAISE SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELAY OR ABANDON SOME OF OUR PLANNED FUTURE EXPENDITURES OR ASPECTS OF OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOW ANALYSIS  A SUMMARY OF OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS SET FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED  \\u200b  \\u200b  AUGUST 3,  \\u200b  AUGUST 4,  \\u200b  \\u200b  2019  2018  \\u200b  \\u200b  (IN THOUSANDS)  PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \\u200b  $97,133  \\u200b  $49,020  \\u200b  USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \\u200b  (25,283)  \\u200b  (42,916)  \\u200b  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  \\u200b  (66,023)  \\u200b  (6,350)  \\u200b  INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS  \\u200b  5,752  \\u200b  (370)  \\u200b  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS AT END OF PERIOD  \\u200b  11,555  \\u200b  24,944  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.

EQUITY RELATED TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED $21.3 MILLION DUE TO $29.2 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $7.9 MILLION OF CASH PAID FOR EMPLOYEE TAXES RELATED TO NET SETTLEMENT OF EQUITY AWARDS.  CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES  0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023  IN JUNE 2018, WE ISSUED IN A PRIVATE OFFERING $300 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 AND ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $35 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT IN CONNECTION WITH THE OVERALLOTMENT OPTION GRANTED TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AS PART OF THE OFFERING (COLLECTIVELY, THE \\u201c2023 NOTES\\u201d). THE 2023 NOTES ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF AN INDENTURE BETWEEN US AND U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS THE TRUSTEE. THE 2023 NOTES WILL MATURE ON JUNE 15, 2023, UNLESS EARLIER PURCHASED BY US OR CONVERTED. THE 2023 NOTES WILL NOT BEAR INTEREST, EXCEPT THAT THE 2023 NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO \\u201cSPECIAL INTEREST\\u201d IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM CERTAIN OF OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 2023 NOTES. THE 2023 NOTES ARE UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND DO NOT CONTAIN ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS, THE INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS OR THE ISSUANCE OR REPURCHASE OF SECURITIES BY US OR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. CERTAIN EVENTS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED \\u201cEVENTS OF DEFAULT\\u201d UNDER THE 2023 NOTES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF THE MATURITY OF THE 2023 NOTES, AS DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 2023 NOTES.  THE INITIAL CONVERSION RATE APPLICABLE TO THE 2023 NOTES IS 5.1640 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2023 NOTES, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $193.65 PER SHARE. THE CONVERSION RATE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN SPECIFIED EVENTS, BUT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST. IN ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A \\u201cMAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE\\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE, WE WILL, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCREASE THE CONVERSION RATE BY A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR A HOLDER THAT ELECTS TO CONVERT ITS 2023 NOTES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.  PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2023, THE 2023 NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE ONLY UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) DURING ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, IF, FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS (WHETHER OR NOT CONSECUTIVE) DURING THE 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD ENDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR QUARTER, THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON SUCH TRADING DAY IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 130% OF THE APPLICABLE CONVERSION PRICE ON SUCH TRADING DAY; (2) DURING THE FIVE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAY PERIOD AFTER ANY TEN CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD IN WHICH, FOR EACH DAY OF THAT PERIOD, THE TRADING PRICE PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2023 NOTES FOR SUCH TRADING DAY WAS LESS THAN 98% OF THE PRODUCT OF THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE APPLICABLE CONVERSION RATE ON SUCH TRADING DAY; OR (3) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIFIED CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, NONE OF THESE CONDITIONS HAVE OCCURRED AND, AS A RESULT, THE 2023 NOTES WERE NOT CONVERTIBLE AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019. ON AND AFTER MARCH 15, 2023, UNTIL THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THE SECOND SCHEDULED TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE MATURITY DATE, HOLDERS MAY CONVERT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2023 NOTES AT ANY TIME, REGARDLESS OF THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES. UPON CONVERSION, THE 2023 NOTES WILL BE SETTLED, AT OUR ELECTION, IN CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  57  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE MAY NOT REDEEM THE 2023 NOTES; HOWEVER, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES), HOLDERS MAY REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2023 NOTES FOR CASH AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2023 NOTES TO BE PURCHASED PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE PURCHASE DATE.  UNDER GAAP, CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH ON CONVERSION ARE REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR AS LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE INSTRUMENT IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUER\\u2019S NON-CONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE. ACCORDINGLY, IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2023 NOTES, WE SEPARATED THE 2023 NOTES INTO LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT WAS CALCULATED BY MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF A SIMILAR LIABILITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN ASSOCIATED CONVERTIBLE FEATURE. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY COMPONENT, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS A DEBT DISCOUNT, REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2023 NOTES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE 2023 NOTES. THE EXCESS OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OVER ITS CARRYING AMOUNT (\\u201cDEBT DISCOUNT\\u201d) WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 6.35% OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2023 NOTES. THE EQUITY COMPONENT IS NOT REMEASURED AS LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO MEET THE CONDITIONS FOR EQUITY CLASSIFICATION.  IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2023 NOTES, WE ALLOCATED THE TOTAL AMOUNT INCURRED TO THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE VALUES. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT ARE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2023 NOTES, AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT ARE NETTED WITH THE EQUITY COMPONENT IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT).  DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE 2023 NOTES WERE COMPRISED OF DISCOUNTS UPON ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF $1.7 MILLION AND THIRD PARTY OFFERING COSTS OF $4.6 MILLION. DISCOUNTS AND THIRD PARTY OFFERING COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT ARE RECORDED AS A CONTRA-LIABILITY AND ARE PRESENTED NET AGAINST THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 BALANCE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  2023 NOTES\\u2014CONVERTIBLE BOND HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS  IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING OF THE 2023 NOTES AND THE EXERCISE OF THE OVERALLOTMENT OPTION IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY WE HAVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $193.65 PER SHARE. THE TOTAL COST OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WAS $91.9 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE SOLD WARRANTS WHEREBY THE HOLDERS OF THE WARRANTS HAVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $309.84 PER SHARE. THE WARRANTS CONTAIN CERTAIN ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS WHEREBY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER SUCH WARRANTS MAY BE INCREASED UP TO A CAP OF 3.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (WHICH CAP MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT). WE RECEIVED $51.0 MILLION IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE WARRANTS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE PURCHASE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES AND SALE OF THE WARRANTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET ANY ACTUAL EARNINGS DILUTION FROM THE CONVERSION OF THE 2023 NOTES UNTIL OUR COMMON STOCK IS ABOVE APPROXIMATELY $309.84 PER SHARE. AS THESE TRANSACTIONS MEET CERTAIN ACCOUNTING CRITERIA, THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES AND WARRANTS ARE RECORDED IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT), ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVES AND ARE NOT REMEASURED EACH REPORTING PERIOD. THE NET COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS WERE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  WE RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $22.3 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT DISCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2023 NOTES AND RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OF $22.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND DEFERRED TAX ASSET ARE RECORDED IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020  IN JUNE 2015, WE ISSUED IN A PRIVATE OFFERING $250 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 AND, IN JULY 2015, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $50 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PURSUANT TO THE EXERCISE OF THE OVERALLOTMENT OPTION GRANTED TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AS PART OF OUR JUNE 2015 OFFERING (COLLECTIVELY, THE \\u201c2020 NOTES\\u201d). THE 2020 NOTES ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF AN INDENTURE BETWEEN US AND U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS THE  58  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRUSTEE. THE 2020 NOTES WILL MATURE ON JULY 15, 2020, UNLESS EARLIER PURCHASED BY US OR CONVERTED. THE 2020 NOTES WILL NOT BEAR INTEREST, EXCEPT THAT THE 2020 NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO \\u201cSPECIAL INTEREST\\u201d IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE EVENT OF OUR FAILURE TO PERFORM CERTAIN OF OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 2020 NOTES. THE 2020 NOTES ARE UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND DO NOT CONTAIN ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS, THE INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS OR THE ISSUANCE OR REPURCHASE OF SECURITIES BY US OR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. CERTAIN EVENTS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED \\u201cEVENTS OF DEFAULT\\u201d UNDER THE 2020 NOTES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF THE MATURITY OF THE 2020 NOTES, AS DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 2020 NOTES. THE 2020 NOTES ARE GUARANTEED BY OUR PRIMARY OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, RESTORATION HARDWARE, INC., AS GUARANTOR. THE GUARANTEE IS THE UNSECURED OBLIGATION OF THE GUARANTOR AND IS SUBORDINATED TO THE GUARANTOR\\u2019S OBLIGATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME WITH RESPECT TO ITS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND RANKS EQUAL IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTOR\\u2019S OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  THE INITIAL CONVERSION RATE APPLICABLE TO THE 2020 NOTES IS 8.4656 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2020 NOTES, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $118.13 PER SHARE. THE CONVERSION RATE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN SPECIFIED EVENTS, BUT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST. IN ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A \\u201cMAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE\\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE, WE WILL, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCREASE THE CONVERSION RATE BY A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR A HOLDER THAT ELECTS TO CONVERT ITS 2020 NOTES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.  PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2020, THE 2020 NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE ONLY UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) DURING ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, IF, FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS (WHETHER OR NOT CONSECUTIVE) DURING THE 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD ENDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR QUARTER, THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON SUCH TRADING DAY IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 130% OF THE APPLICABLE CONVERSION PRICE ON SUCH TRADING DAY; (2) DURING THE FIVE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAY PERIOD AFTER ANY TEN CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD IN WHICH, FOR EACH DAY OF THAT PERIOD, THE TRADING PRICE PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2020 NOTES FOR SUCH TRADING DAY WAS LESS THAN 98% OF THE PRODUCT OF THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE APPLICABLE CONVERSION RATE ON SUCH TRADING DAY; OR (3) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIFIED CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, NONE OF THESE CONDITIONS HAVE OCCURRED AND, AS A RESULT, THE 2020 NOTES WERE NOT CONVERTIBLE AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019. ON AND AFTER MARCH 15, 2020, UNTIL THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THE SECOND SCHEDULED TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE MATURITY DATE, HOLDERS MAY CONVERT ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2020 NOTES AT ANY TIME, REGARDLESS OF THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES. UPON CONVERSION, THE 2020 NOTES WILL BE SETTLED, AT OUR ELECTION, IN CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  WE MAY NOT REDEEM THE 2020 NOTES; HOWEVER, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES), HOLDERS MAY REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2020 NOTES FOR CASH AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2020 NOTES TO BE PURCHASED PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE PURCHASE DATE.  UNDER GAAP, CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH ON CONVERSION ARE REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR AS LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE INSTRUMENT IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUER\\u2019S NON-CONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE. ACCORDINGLY, IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2020 NOTES, WE SEPARATED THE 2020 NOTES INTO LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT WAS CALCULATED BY MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF A SIMILAR LIABILITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN ASSOCIATED CONVERTIBLE FEATURE. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY COMPONENT, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS A DEBT DISCOUNT, REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2020 NOTES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE 2020 NOTES. THE DEBT DISCOUNT WILL BE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 6.47% OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2020 NOTES. THE EQUITY COMPONENT IS NOT REMEASURED AS LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO MEET THE CONDITIONS FOR EQUITY CLASSIFICATION.  IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2020 NOTES, WE ALLOCATED THE TOTAL AMOUNT INCURRED TO THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE VALUES. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT ARE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2020 NOTES, AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT ARE NETTED WITH THE EQUITY COMPONENT IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT).  DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE 2020 NOTES WERE COMPRISED OF DISCOUNTS UPON ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF $3.8 MILLION AND THIRD PARTY OFFERING COSTS OF $2.3 MILLION. DISCOUNTS AND THIRD PARTY OFFERING COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY  59  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPONENT ARE RECORDED AS A CONTRA-LIABILITY AND ARE PRESENTED NET AGAINST THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020 BALANCE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  2020 NOTES\\u2014CONVERTIBLE BOND HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS  IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING OF THE 2020 NOTES IN JUNE 2015 AND THE EXERCISE IN FULL OF THE OVERALLOTMENT OPTION IN JULY 2015, WE ENTERED INTO CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY WE HAVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $118.13 PER SHARE. THE TOTAL COST OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WAS $68.3 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE SOLD WARRANTS WHEREBY THE HOLDERS OF THE WARRANTS HAVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $189.00 PER SHARE. THE WARRANTS CONTAIN CERTAIN ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS WHEREBY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER SUCH WARRANTS MAY BE INCREASED UP TO A CAP OF 5.1 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (WHICH CAP MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT). WE RECEIVED $30.4 MILLION IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE WARRANTS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE PURCHASE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES AND SALE OF THE WARRANTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET ANY ACTUAL EARNINGS DILUTION FROM THE CONVERSION OF THE 2020 NOTES UNTIL OUR COMMON STOCK IS ABOVE APPROXIMATELY $189.00 PER SHARE. AS THESE TRANSACTIONS MEET CERTAIN ACCOUNTING CRITERIA, THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES AND WARRANTS ARE RECORDED IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT), ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVES AND ARE NOT REMEASURED EACH REPORTING PERIOD. THE NET COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS WERE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  WE RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $32.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT DISCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2020 NOTES AND RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OF $26.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND DEFERRED TAX ASSET ARE RECORDED IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2019  IN JUNE 2014, WE ISSUED $350 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 0.00% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2019 (THE \\u201c2019 NOTES\\u201d) IN A PRIVATE OFFERING.

THE 2019 NOTES WERE UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND DID NOT CONTAIN ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS, THE INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS OR THE ISSUANCE OR REPURCHASE OF SECURITIES BY US OR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. CERTAIN EVENTS WERE ALSO CONSIDERED \\u201cEVENTS OF DEFAULT\\u201d UNDER THE 2019 NOTES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE ACCELERATION OF THE MATURITY OF THE 2019 NOTES, AS DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 2019 NOTES. THE 2019 NOTES MATURED ON JUNE 15, 2019.  THE INITIAL CONVERSION RATE APPLICABLE TO THE 2019 NOTES WAS 8.6143 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2019 NOTES, WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $116.09 PER SHARE. THE CONVERSION RATE WAS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN SPECIFIED EVENTS, BUT WAS NOT ADJUSTED FOR ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST. IN ADDITION, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A \\u201cMAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE,\\u201d WE WOULD, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCREASE THE CONVERSION RATE BY A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR A HOLDER THAT ELECTED TO CONVERT ITS 2019 NOTES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MAKE-WHOLE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.  PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2019, THE 2019 NOTES WERE CONVERTIBLE ONLY UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES: (1) DURING ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, IF, FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS (WHETHER OR NOT CONSECUTIVE) DURING THE 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD ENDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR QUARTER, THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON SUCH TRADING DAY IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 130% OF THE APPLICABLE CONVERSION PRICE ON SUCH TRADING DAY; (2) DURING THE FIVE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAY PERIOD AFTER ANY TEN CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD IN WHICH, FOR EACH DAY OF THAT PERIOD, THE TRADING PRICE PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2019 NOTES FOR SUCH TRADING DAY WAS LESS THAN 98% OF THE PRODUCT OF THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE APPLICABLE CONVERSION RATE ON SUCH TRADING DAY; OR (3) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIFIED CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS. ON AND AFTER MARCH 15, 2019, UNTIL THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THE SECOND SCHEDULED TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE MATURITY DATE, HOLDERS COULD HAVE CONVERTED ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2019 NOTES AT ANY TIME, REGARDLESS OF THE FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES.  60  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN JUNE 2019, UPON THE MATURITY OF THE 2019 NOTES, $350.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2019 NOTES WERE SETTLED FOR $349.0 MILLION IN CASH AND 42 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $1.0 MILLION. AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, THE 2019 NOTES ARE NO LONGER OUTSTANDING.  UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE (AS DEFINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE NOTES), HOLDERS COULD HAVE REQUIRED US TO PURCHASE ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR 2019 NOTES FOR CASH AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2019 NOTES TO BE PURCHASED PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID SPECIAL INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE PURCHASE DATE.  UNDER GAAP, CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH ON CONVERSION ARE REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR AS LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE INSTRUMENT IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUER\\u2019S NON-CONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE. ACCORDINGLY, IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2019 NOTES, WE SEPARATED THE 2019 NOTES INTO LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT WAS CALCULATED BY MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF A SIMILAR LIABILITY THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN ASSOCIATED CONVERTIBLE FEATURE. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY COMPONENT, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED AS A DEBT DISCOUNT, REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2019 NOTES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE 2019 NOTES. THE DEBT DISCOUNT WAS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF 4.51% OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2019 NOTES. THE EQUITY COMPONENT WAS NOT REMEASURED AS LONG AS IT CONTINUED TO MEET THE CONDITIONS FOR EQUITY CLASSIFICATION.  IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2019 NOTES, WE ALLOCATED THE TOTAL AMOUNT INCURRED TO THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE VALUES. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT WERE AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE 2019 NOTES, AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT WERE NETTED WITH THE EQUITY COMPONENT IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY (DEFICIT).  DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE 2019 NOTES WERE COMPRISED OF DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS PAYABLE TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS OF $4.4 MILLION AND THIRD PARTY OFFERING COSTS OF $1.0 MILLION. DISCOUNTS, COMMISSIONS PAYABLE TO THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AND THIRD PARTY OFFERING COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT WERE RECORDED AS A CONTRA-LIABILITY AND WERE PRESENTED NET AGAINST THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2019 BALANCE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  2019 NOTES\\u2014CONVERTIBLE BOND HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS  IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING OF THE 2019 NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WHEREBY WE HAD THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 3.0 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $116.09 PER SHARE. THE TOTAL COST OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS WAS $73.3 MILLION. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TERMINATED UPON THE MATURITY DATE OF THE 2019 NOTES. IN ADDITION, WE SOLD WARRANTS WHEREBY THE HOLDERS OF THE WARRANTS HAVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 3.0 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $171.98 PER SHARE. THE WARRANTS CONTAIN CERTAIN ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS WHEREBY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER SUCH WARRANTS MAY BE INCREASED UP TO A CAP OF 6.0 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (WHICH CAP MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT). THE WARRANTS WILL EXPIRE THROUGH DECEMBER 2019. WE RECEIVED $40.4 MILLION IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE WARRANTS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE PURCHASE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES AND SALE OF THE WARRANTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET ANY ACTUAL DILUTION FROM THE CONVERSION OF THE 2019 NOTES AND TO EFFECTIVELY INCREASE THE OVERALL CONVERSION PRICE FROM $116.09 PER SHARE TO $171.98 PER SHARE. AS THESE TRANSACTIONS MET CERTAIN ACCOUNTING CRITERIA, THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGES WERE, AND WARRANTS ARE, RECORDED IN STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY AND ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVES. THE NET COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE AND WARRANT TRANSACTIONS WERE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  WE RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $27.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT DISCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2019 NOTES AND RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX ASSET OF $28.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND DEFERRED TAX ASSET WERE RECORDED IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THERE IS NO DEFERRED TAX ASSET OR LIABILITY REMAINING AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019 DUE TO THE MATURITY OF THE 2019 NOTES.  61  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ASSET BASED CREDIT FACILITY  IN AUGUST 2011, RESTORATION HARDWARE, INC., ALONG WITH ITS CANADIAN SUBSIDIARY, RESTORATION HARDWARE CANADA, INC., ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND CERTAIN OTHER LENDERS.

THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AT ANY GIVEN TIME UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS LIMITED BY REFERENCE TO A BORROWING BASE FORMULA BASED UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VALUE OF ELIGIBLE INVENTORY AND ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. AS A RESULT OF THE BORROWING BASE FORMULA, ACTUAL BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT COULD BE LESS THAN THE STATED AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT (AS REDUCED BY THE ACTUAL BORROWINGS AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT).

WE DETERMINE THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE LEASE AND ANY RELATED FINANCING EXPENSES UPON THE LEASE\\u2019S COMMENCEMENT, WHICH FOR REAL ESTATE LEASES IS GENERALLY UPON STORE OPENING OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, WHEN WE TAKE POSSESSION OR CONTROL OF THE ASSET.  AS MOST OF OUR LEASES DO NOT INCLUDE AN IMPLICIT INTEREST RATE, WE DETERMINE THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR EACH LEASE BASED UPON THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE (\\u201cIBR\\u201d) IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE. THE IBR IS COMPUTED AS THE RATE OF INTEREST THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO (I) BORROW ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS (II) OVER A SIMILAR TERM (III) AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE TOTAL LEASE PAYMENTS AND (IV) IN A SIMILAR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. WE UTILIZE OUR ASSET BASED CREDIT FACILITY AS THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING THE APPLICABLE IBR FOR EACH LEASE.  CERTAIN OF OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF RETAIL SALES OVER CONTRACTUAL LEVELS. DUE TO THE VARIABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE NATURE OF SUCH PAYMENTS, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY RELATED TO SUCH PAYMENTS. ESTIMATED VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  WE HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF LEASES THAT INCLUDE RENTAL PAYMENTS PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION (E.G., BASED ON THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX). WE INCLUDE THESE VARIABLE PAYMENTS IN THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY IF SUCH INCREASES HAVE A MINIMUM RENT ESCALATION (E.G., FLOOR). HOWEVER, WE EXCLUDE THESE VARIABLE PAYMENTS FROM THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY IN THE CASE OF LEASE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DO NOT SPECIFY A MINIMUM RENT ESCALATION.  WE RENT OR SUBLEASE CERTAIN REAL ESTATE TO THIRD PARTIES UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND RECOGNIZE RENTAL INCOME RECEIVED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  LEASE ARRANGEMENTS MAY REQUIRE THE LANDLORD TO PROVIDE TENANT ALLOWANCES DIRECTLY TO US. STANDARD TENANT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS, TYPICALLY THOSE RECEIVED UNDER OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS, ARE RECORDED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH AN OFFSET RECORDED IN LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TENANT ALLOWANCES ARE PROVIDED FOR US TO DESIGN AND BUILD THE LEASED ASSET. TENANT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF A LEASED ASSET AND PRIOR TO LEASE COMMENCEMENT ARE RECORDED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH AN OFFSET RECORDED IN OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS (TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE INCURRED RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE FOR CONSTRUCTION COSTS) OR IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES (TO THE EXTENT THAT PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED PRIOR TO CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES BY US) ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AFTER THE LEASED ASSET IS CONSTRUCTED AND THE LEASE COMMENCES, WE RECLASSIFY THE TENANT ALLOWANCE FROM OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES TO LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  LEASE CLASSIFICATION  CERTAIN OF OUR REAL ESTATE AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE HELD UNDER FINANCE LEASES. LEASE RELATED ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN FINANCE LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS WITHIN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  \\u2014NET  ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  LEASES THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A FINANCE LEASE ARE CONSIDERED OPERATING LEASES. LEASE RELATED ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  CONSTRUCTION RELATED ACTIVITIES  WE ARE SOMETIMES INVOLVED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEASED STORES FOR CERTAIN OF OUR NEWER DESIGN GALLERIES. PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION COMMENCEMENT, WE EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT WE, AS LESSEE, CONTROL THE ASSET BEING CONSTRUCTED AND, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, MAY BE THE \\u201cDEEMED OWNER\\u201d OF THE LEASED ASSET FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD.  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IF WE ARE NOT THE \\u201cDEEMED OWNER\\u201d FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD, SUCH LEASE IS CLASSIFIED AS EITHER AN OPERATING OR FINANCE LEASE UPON LEASE COMMENCEMENT. DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD AND PRIOR TO LEASE COMMENCEMENT, ANY CAPITAL AMOUNTS CONTRIBUTED BY US TOWARD THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE LEASED ASSET (EXCLUDING NORMAL LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED WITHIN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\\u2014NET) ARE RECORDED AS \\u201cLANDLORD ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION\\u201d WITHIN OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (REFER TO NOTE 3\\u2014  PREPAID EXPENSE AND OTHER ASSETS  ). UPON COMPLETION OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, AND UPON LEASE COMMENCEMENT, WE RECLASSIFY AMOUNTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DETERMINED TO BE THE LANDLORD ASSET TO LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS DETERMINED NOT TO BE PART OF THE LEASED ASSET ARE CLASSIFIED AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\\u2014NET ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  IF WE ARE THE \\u201cDEEMED OWNER\\u201d FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, UPON COMMENCEMENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO CAPITALIZE (I) COSTS INCURRED BY US AND (II) THE CASH AND NON-CASH ASSETS CONTRIBUTED BY THE LANDLORD FOR CONSTRUCTION AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ON ITS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS BUILD-TO-SUIT ASSETS, WITH AN OFFSETTING FINANCING OBLIGATION FOR THE AMOUNT FUNDED BY THE LANDLORD. THE CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE LANDLORD TOWARD CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING THE BUILDING, EXISTING SITE IMPROVEMENTS AT CONSTRUCTION COMMENCEMENT AND ANY AMOUNTS PAID BY THE LANDLORD TO THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSTRUCTION, ARE INCLUDED AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS DUE TO BUILD-TO-SUIT LEASE TRANSACTIONS WITHIN THE NON-CASH SECTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. OVER THE LEASE TERM, THESE NON-CASH ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT DO NOT IMPACT OUR CASH OUTFLOWS, NOR DO THEY IMPACT NET INCOME WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  UPON COMPLETION OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT, WE PERFORM A SALE-LEASEBACK ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF WE CAN DERECOGNIZE THE BUILD-TO-SUIT ASSET AND CORRESPONDING FINANCING OBLIGATION. IF THE ASSET AND LIABILITY CANNOT BE DERECOGNIZED, WE ACCOUNT FOR THE AGREEMENT AS A DEBT-LIKE ARRANGEMENT.  \\u200b  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO NOTE 2\\u2014  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY PROPOSED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS.\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"RH\", \"CIK\": 1528849, \"Date\": \"2019-09-11T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"RH\", \"Name\": \"Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NYSE\", \"SIC\": 5712.0, \"Business\": \"CA\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 453052669.0, \"key\": \"20190911RH\", \"labelr1\": 1.2997903563941395, \"labelr2\": 2.6667455061494745, \"labelr3\": -2.3440649657317247, \"labelr4\": 1.8695447039396007, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5605939, \"prof1\": 0.43940607, \"return1&2\": 0.9606812623837491, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9832002552876355, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.9648188869857852, \"return2\": 0.9733325449385052, \"return1\": 0.9870020964360586, \"return3\": 1.0234406496573172, \"return4\": 0.981304552960604, \"1_day_return\": 1.299790356394137, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.017220275559030208, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": -0.0, \"indexx\": 2399, \"returnpred\": -1.2997903563941395, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.0124291833948058, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.7372685437749161, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9734267559031969, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0355438576901401, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0407546095421445}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 2410, \"level_0\": 2472, \"index\": 5523, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

IN DECEMBER 2017, WE ACQUIRED OUTWARD, INC., A 3-D IMAGING AND AUGMENTED REALITY PLATFORM FOR THE HOME FURNISHINGS AND DE\\u0301COR INDUSTRY.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019\\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED JULY 29, 2018 (\\u201cSECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018\\u201d) AND THE TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2019 (\\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2019\\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED JULY 29, 2018 (\\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2018\\u201d), SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO. ALL EXPLANATIONS OF CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS  NET REVENUES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCREASED BY $95,640,000, OR 7.5%, COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WITH COMPARABLE BRAND REVENUE GROWTH OF 6.5%. THIS GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WEST ELM, POTTERY BARN AND POTTERY BARN KIDS AND TEEN. NET REVENUE GROWTH INCLUDED AN 8.7% INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR FRANCHISE OPERATIONS.  WEST ELM HAD A STRONG QUARTER WITH COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH ACCELERATING TO 17.5%, ON TOP OF 9.5% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THESE RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY STRONG EXECUTION ACROSS ALL OUR KEY GROWTH STRATEGIES. IN POTTERY BARN, COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH ACCELERATED TO 4.2% AND CONTINUED TO BE LED BY FURNITURE, WITH STRENGTH IN OUR PROPRIETARY UPHOLSTERY BUSINESS. IN POTTERY BARN KIDS AND TEEN, COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH WAS 3.7%. OUR BABY BUSINESS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT GROWTH INITIATIVE, AND DURING THE QUARTER, WE SAW SIGNIFICANT GROWTH ACROSS OUR BACK-TO-SCHOOL OFFERINGS AND FOUNDATIONAL FURNITURE CATEGORIES. OUR EMERGING BRANDS, REJUVENATION AND MARK & GRAHAM DROVE ANOTHER QUARTER OF SOLID GROWTH. IN THE WILLIAMS SONOMA BRAND, WHILE WE ARE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 1.1% COMPARABLE REVENUE DECLINE THIS QUARTER, WE DID HAVE COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH IN OUR FULL-PRICE BUSINESS AND NEW INTRODUCTIONS WERE SOLID. HOWEVER, THEY WEREN\\u2019T STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE CLEARANCE VOLUME, MISSES IN TABLETOP AND THE VERY SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF INSTANT POT LAST YEAR. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WAS $0.79 (WHICH INCLUDED A $0.07 IMPACT RELATED TO OUTWARD, INC., AND A $0.01 IMPACT FROM EMPLOYMENT-RELATED EXPENSES) VERSUS $0.62 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 (WHICH INCLUDED A $0.05 IMPACT RELATED TO OUTWARD, INC., A $0.05 IMPACT RELATED TO IMPAIRMENT AND EARLY LEASE TERMINATION CHARGES, A $0.03 IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH TAX EXPENSE FROM U.S. TAX REFORM, AND A $0.02 IMPACT FROM EMPLOYMENT-RELATED EXPENSES). WE ALSO RETURNED $76,868,000 TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.  OPERATIONALLY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ALSO MADE PROGRESS ACROSS OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF DRIVING GROWTH THROUGH CROSS-BRAND INITIATIVES AND IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS.  A KEY DRIVER OF OUR ACCELERATED GROWTH THIS QUARTER WAS THE FOCUS ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS. THE KEY CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPACTFUL DRIVER OF CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT AND REVENUE GROWTH AS TOTAL MEMBERSHIP CONTINUED TO GROW DURING THE QUARTER. OUR CROSS-BRAND BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS DIVISION ALSO DELIVERED STRONG GROWTH THIS QUARTER AND WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY WORKING TO PUT IN PLACE THE CROSS-BRAND, CROSS-FUNCTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH, AS WELL AS EXPANDING OUR LARGE-SCALE PROJECT PIPELINE WITH MORE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS INDUSTRY VERTICALS.  ALSO, DURING THE QUARTER, WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. IN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED OUR TECHNOLOGY EXPERIMENTATION AGENDA WITH THE LAUNCH OF MANY NEW CAPABILITIES OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, ACROSS EACH OF OUR BRANDS, TO DELIVER MORE ENGAGING, CONTENT-RICH CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES. IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THIS QUARTER, WE LAUNCHED FURNITURE DELIVERY SCHEDULING CAPABILITY WHICH GIVES CUSTOMERS THE OPTION TO SCHEDULE THEIR DELIVERY ON THEIR MOBILE DEVICES. WE ADDED FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS SUCH AS EMAIL AND MOBILE NOTIFICATIONS TO OUR ORDER TRACKING CAPABILITY LAUNCHED IN THE FIRST QUARTER. AND, IN THE SECOND QUARTER, WE SUCCESSFULLY OPENED OUR WEST ELM WEST COAST DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN FONTANA, CALIFORNIA, WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN SEPTEMBER. AND FINALLY, OUR IN-HOUSE MANUFACTURING OPERATION CONTINUES TO BE A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR US, WHERE SHIPMENTS ARE UP 30% YEAR-OVER-YEAR AS WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS TO ENABLE MORE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION, WHICH HELPS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE CHINA TARIFFS.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 WE PLAN TO DRIVE CROSS-BRAND INITIATIVES THAT LEVERAGE OUR PLATFORM, AND WE PLAN TO BRING TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT THE EXECUTION OF OUR INITIATIVES THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 AND BEYOND, AS WELL AS TO DELIVER LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

OVERVIEW  WE  ARE ENGAGED IN THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF HOTEL PROPERTIES. AT JULY 31, 2019, THE TRUST HAD TWO MODERATE -SERVICE HOTELS IN  TUCSON, ARIZONA AND ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO WITH 267 HOTEL SUITES, AND MANAGED A THIRD HOTEL IN TEMPE, ARIZONA. BOTH OF OUR HOTELS  ARE BRANDED THROUGH MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH BEST WESTERN, AND BOTH ARE TRADEMARKED AS INNSUITES HOTELS. WE ARE ALSO INVOLVED  IN VARIOUS OPERATIONS INCIDENTAL TO THE OPERATION OF HOTELS, SUCH AS THE OPERATION OF RESTAURANTS AND MEETING/BANQUET ROOM RENTALS.  AT JULY 31, 2019, WE OWNED, THROUGH OUR SOLE  GENERAL PARTNER\\u2019S INTEREST IN THE PARTNERSHIP, A DIRECT 20.53% INTEREST IN THE ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO HOTEL, AND, TOGETHER  WITH THE PARTNERSHIP, OWNED AN INDIRECT 51.01% INTEREST IN THE TUCSON, ARIZONA. HOTEL.  OUR  OPERATIONS CONSIST OF ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT \\u2013 HOTEL OPERATIONS & HOTEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES. HOTEL OPERATIONS DERIVES  ITS REVENUE FROM THE OPERATION OF THE TRUST\\u2019S TWO HOTEL PROPERTIES WITH AN AGGREGATE OF 267 SUITES IN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO.  HOTEL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, PROVIDES MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THE TRUST\\u2019S TWO HOTELS AND A NON-OWNED HOTEL IN TEMPE, ARIZONA.  AS PART OF OUR MANAGEMENT SERVICES, WE ALSO PROVIDE TRADEMARK AND LICENSING SERVICES.  28  OUR  RESULTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OCCUPANCY AND ROOM RATES AT THE HOTELS, OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS, CHANGES IN ROOM RATES,  AND CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE SUITES CAUSED BY THE TRUST\\u2019S DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES. RESULTS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY  IMPACTED BY OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS IN THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD NEGATIVELY  IMPACT HOTEL ROOM DEMAND AND PRICING, WHICH WOULD REDUCE OUR PROFIT MARGINS ON RENTED SUITES. ADDITIONALLY, OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE  COSTS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES, RESULTING IN LOWER OPERATING MARGINS AND HIGHER  HOURLY LABOR COSTS. EITHER A FURTHER INCREASE IN SUPPLY OR A FURTHER DECLINE IN DEMAND COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION,  WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE RATES AND REVENUE OF THE HOTELS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.  WE  ARE EXPERIENCING SLIGHTLY STRONGER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019. WE  ANTICIPATE THAT THIS ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE DURING FISCAL 2020. WE EXPECT THE MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 TO BE THE CONTINUATION  OF STRONG COMPETITION FOR CORPORATE LEISURE GROUP AND GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH MAY AFFECT  OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE ROOM RATES WHILE MAINTAINING MARKET SHARE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE POSITIONED THE HOTELS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE  THROUGH REFURBISHMENT, BY OFFERING A RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF TWO-ROOM SUITES AT EACH LOCATION, AND BY MAINTAINING A ROBUST  COMPLEMENTARY GUEST ITEMS AND A FREE INTERNET ACCESS SYSTEM.  OUR  STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO OBTAIN THE FULL BENEFIT OF OUR REAL ESTATE EQUITY, BY MARKETING THE HOTELS AT ATTRACTIVE CURRENT PRICES.  IN ADDITION, THE TRUST IS SEEKING A PUBLIC, OR LARGE PRIVATE MERGER PARTNER THAT MAY BENEFIT FROM A MERGER THAT WOULD AFFORD  THAT PARTNER ACCESS TO OUR LISTING ON THE NYSE AMERICAN. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR STRATEGIC PLAN, INCLUDING INFORMATION ON  OUR PROGRESS IN DISPOSING OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES, SEE \\u201cFUTURE POSITIONING\\u201d IN THIS MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  HOTEL  OPERATIONS  OUR  EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROPERTY TAXES, INSURANCE, CORPORATE OVERHEAD, INTEREST ON MORTGAGE DEBT, PROFESSIONAL FEES, DEPRECIATION  OF THE HOTELS AND HOTEL OPERATING EXPENSES. HOTEL OPERATING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PAYROLL, GUEST AND MAINTENANCE SUPPLIES,  MARKETING AND UTILITIES EXPENSES. UNDER THE TERMS OF ITS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, THE PARTNERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE US FOR  ALL SUCH EXPENSES. ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A REVIEW OF THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE HOTELS,  PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO OCCUPANCY, WHICH IS CALCULATED AS ROOMS SOLD DIVIDED BY TOTAL ROOMS AVAILABLE, AVERAGE DAILY RATE  (\\u201c  ADR  \\u201d), CALCULATED AS TOTAL ROOM REVENUE DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF ROOMS SOLD, AND REVENUE PER AVAILABLE  ROOM (\\u201c  REVPAR  \\u201d), CALCULATED AS TOTAL ROOM REVENUE DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF ROOMS AVAILABLE, IS APPROPRIATE  FOR UNDERSTANDING REVENUE FROM THE HOTELS.

WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS  AT OUR TUCSON, ARIZONA PROPERTY DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THIS EXPENSE WILL DECREASE  IN THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.

THE PARTNERSHIP\\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF REVENUE IS HOTEL OPERATIONS FOR THE ONE HOTEL  PROPERTY IT OWNS IN TUCSON, ARIZONA. OUR LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, WILL DEPEND  UPON OUR ABILITY, AND THE PARTNERSHIP\\u2019S ABILITY, TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FROM HOTEL OPERATIONS AND TO SERVICE OUR  DEBT.  HOTEL  OPERATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OCCUPANCY AND ROOM RATES AT THE HOTELS. WE ANTICIPATE OCCUPANCY AND ADR WILL CONTINUE  TO GROW MODERATELY DURING THIS COMING YEAR AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.  WITH APPROXIMATELY  $2,101,000 OF CASH AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND THE AVAILABILITY OF A $150,000 BANK LINE OF CREDIT, A $1,000,000  RELATED PARTY DEMAND/REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT/PROMISSORY NOTE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR TWO AVAILABLE ADVANCES TO AFFILIATE  CREDIT FACILITIES FOR A TOTAL OF $1,000,000 MAXIMUM BORROWING CAPACITY, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH CASH ON HAND TO MEET  ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE ISSUANCE DATE OF THE THESE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR MANAGEMENT IS ANALYZING OTHER STRATEGIC OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US, INCLUDING RAISING ADDITIONAL  FUNDS, ADDITIONAL ASSET SALES, INCREASING BORROWINGS AT EITHER, OR BOTH, THE ALBUQUERQUE AND TUCSON HOTELS AND USING THE FUNDS  GENERATED TO PAY INTERCOMPANY LOANS (1) DUE FROM THE TUCSON HOTEL TO THE PARTNERSHIP OF APPROXIMATELY $3.2 MILLION, AND  (2) DUE FROM THE ALBUQUERQUE HOTEL DUE TO THE TRUST OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION (3) AND OTHER DUE FROM AFFILIATES; HOWEVER,  SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL.  THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN REFINANCING DEBT OR RAISING ADDITIONAL OR REPLACEMENT FUNDS, OR THAT THESE FUNDS  MAY BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO US. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL OR REPLACEMENT FUNDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED  TO SELL CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WHICH MAY NOT BE ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE.  WE  ANTICIPATE SOME ADDITIONAL NEW-BUILD HOTEL SUPPLY DURING THE REMAINING FISCAL YEAR 2020, AND ACCORDINGLY WE ANTICIPATE SOME ADDITIONAL  PRESSURE ON REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS. WE EXPECT THE MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR THE UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR TO BE THE CONTINUATION  OF STRONG COMPETITION FOR CORPORATE, LEISURE, GROUP, AND GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH MAY AFFECT  OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE ROOM RATES WHILE MAINTAINING MARKET SHARE.

THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE  IN CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018 WAS  DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OPERATING LIABILITIES RELATED TO ONGOING OPERATIONS.

THE  FUND IS RESTRICTED BY THE MORTGAGE LENDER FOR ONE OF OUR PROPERTIES. AS OF JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, THERE WERE NO MONIES HELD IN  THESE ACCOUNTS REPORTED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS \\u201cRESTRICTED CASH.\\u201d THE FUND IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HOTELS AND REFURBISHMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT. DURING THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, THE HOTELS SPENT APPROXIMATELY $190,000 AND $516,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS AT THE HOTELS, AS REQUIRED TO MEET CONTINUING BEST  WESTERN STANDARDS. WE CONSIDER THE MAJORITY OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO BE REVENUE PRODUCING. THEREFORE, THESE AMOUNTS ARE CAPITALIZED  AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. FOR THE REMAINING FISCAL YEAR 2020 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WE PLAN ON SPENDING  LESS ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AS WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS AT OUR TUCSON, ARIZONA HOTEL WHICH REQUIRED SIGNIFICANT  AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDING JULY 31, 2019. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE WERE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS  INCURRED AND APPROXIMATED $202,000 AND $196,000 FOR CONTINUED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  35  WE  HAVE MINIMUM DEBT PAYMENTS, NET OF DEBT DISCOUNTS, OF APPROXIMATELY $921,000 AND APPROXIMATELY $484,000 DUE DURING FISCAL YEARS  2020 AND 2021, RESPECTIVELY.

ANY DEBT INCURRED OR ISSUED BY US MAY BE SECURED  OR UNSECURED, LONG-TERM, MEDIUM-TERM OR SHORT-TERM, BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED OR VARIABLE RATE AND BE SUBJECT TO SUCH OTHER TERMS  AS WE CONSIDER PRUDENT.  COMPETITION  IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY  THE  HOTEL INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT THE MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020 (\\u201cFISCAL  YEAR 2020\\u201d) TO BE THE CONTINUATION OF COMPETITION FOR CORPORATE LEISURE GROUP AND GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IN THE MARKETS IN  WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE ROOM RATES WHILE MAINTAINING MARKET SHARE. EACH OF THE HOTELS, AND  THE TEMPE HOTEL FACES COMPETITION PRIMARILY FROM OTHER MID-MARKET HOTELS LOCATED IN ITS IMMEDIATE VICINITY, BUT ALSO COMPETES  WITH HOTEL PROPERTIES LOCATED IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, AND INCREASINGLY FROM ALTERNATIVE LODGING FACILITIES, SUCH AS AIRBNB.  WHILE NONE OF THE HOTELS\\u2019 COMPETITORS DOMINATE ANY OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, SOME OF THOSE COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER  MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN THE TRUST.  CERTAIN  ADDITIONAL HOTEL PROPERTY REFURBISHMENTS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN COMPLETED BY COMPETITORS IN BOTH OF THE HOTELS\\u2019 MARKETS, AND  ADDITIONAL HOTEL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENTS MAY BE BUILT IN THE FUTURE. SUCH HOTEL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE HAD, AND COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE,  AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE REVENUE OF OUR HOTELS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.  THE  TRUST\\u2019S HOTEL INVESTMENTS ARE LOCATED IN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO. WITH THE COMPLETED RENOVATIONS AT OUR TUCSON, ARIZONA AND  ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO HOTEL PROPERTIES, THOSE HOTELS HAVE SEEN ADDITIONAL DEMAND AS SUPPLY HAS BEEN STEADY IN THOSE RESPECTIVE  MARKETS. EITHER AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY OR A DECLINE IN DEMAND COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COMPETITION, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OCCUPANCY, ROOM RATES AND REVENUES OF OUR HOTELS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.  THE  TRUST MAY ALSO COMPETE FOR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES. THESE ENTITIES  ALSO MAY GENERALLY ACCEPT MORE RISK THAN THE TRUST CAN PRUDENTLY MANAGE. COMPETITION MAY GENERALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SUITABLE  FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THE TRUST AND INCREASE THE BARGAINING POWER OF OWNERS SEEKING TO SELL THEIR PROPERTIES.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN  OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 FILED WITH THE SEC ON JUNE 19, 2019, WE IDENTIFIED THE  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT AFFECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN PREPARING OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POLICIES WE FOLLOW FOR THE VALUATION OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY  OF OUR ASSETS, ARE OUR MOST CRITICAL POLICIES WHICH HAS NOT CHANGED IN THE PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2019. THOSE POLICIES INCLUDE  METHODS USED TO RECOGNIZE AND MEASURE ANY IDENTIFIED IMPAIRMENT OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTY ASSETS.  36  ASSET  IMPAIRMENT  WE  BELIEVE THAT THE POLICIES WE FOLLOW FOR THE VALUATION OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF OUR ASSETS, ARE  OUR MOST CRITICAL POLICIES. THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) HAS ISSUED AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE RELATED  TO THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, CODIFIED IN ASC TOPIC 360-10-35, WHICH WE APPLY TO DETERMINE WHEN IT IS NECESSARY  TO TEST AN ASSET FOR RECOVERABILITY. ON AN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BASIS, WE REVIEW THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES.  WE WILL RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS AND REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF A PROPERTY WHEN ANTICIPATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS  AND THE CURRENT MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY DO NOT SUPPORT ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN CASES WHERE WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE  CARRYING COST OF HOTEL PROPERTIES HELD FOR USE, WE WILL REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HOTEL, AS DETERMINED  BY A CURRENT APPRAISAL OR OTHER ACCEPTABLE VALUATION METHODS. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE A HOTEL PROPERTIES IMPAIRMENT LOSS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 OR 2018. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, OUR MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ANY OF  OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES ARE IMPAIRED.

AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2017, THE TRUST HAS DECIDED TO RECLASSIFY THESE ASSETS BACK INTO OPERATIONS AS MANY OF THESE  ASSETS HAVE BEEN MARKETED FOR SALE FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR. AT THIS TIME, THE TRUST IS UNABLE TO PREDICT WHEN, AND IF, ANY OF THESE  HOTEL PROPERTIES WILL BE SOLD AND THE TRUST NO LONGER DEEMS A SALE TO BE PROBABLE. THE TRUST CONTINUES TO LIST THESE PROPERTIES  WITH LOCAL REAL ESTATE HOTEL BROKERS AND, WE BELIEVE, THAT EACH OF THE ASSETS IS BEING MARKETED AT A PRICE THAT IS REASONABLE  IN RELATION TO ITS CURRENT FAIR VALUE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR BASIS OF PRESENTATION SINCE OCTOBER 31,  2017.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  ASU  2014-09 (TOPIC 606), \\u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\\u201d IS EFFECTIVE FOR REPORTING PERIOD AFTER JANUARY 1, 2018.  ASU 2014-09 REQUIRES ENTITIES TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A FIVE-STEP MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES IDENTIFICATION  OF THE CONTRACT, IDENTIFICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, DETERMINATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE, ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION  PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AS THE ENTITY SATISFIES THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  REVENUES  ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND WHEN COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY  ASSURED. AMOUNTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF REVENUE RECOGNITION ARE CONSIDERED DEFERRED LIABILITIES.  REVENUES  PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ROOM RENTALS, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, MANAGEMENT AND TRADEMARK FEES AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES FROM  OUR PROPERTIES. REVENUES ARE RECORDED WHEN ROOMS ARE OCCUPIED AND WHEN FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES ARE DELIVERED. MANAGEMENT AND TRADEMARK  FEES FROM NON-AFFILIATED HOTELS INCLUDE A MONTHLY ACCOUNTING FEE AND A PERCENTAGE OF HOTEL ROOM REVENUES FOR MANAGING THE DAILY  OPERATIONS OF THE HOTELS AND THE ONE HOTEL OWNED BY AFFILIATES OF MR. WIRTH.  EACH  ROOM NIGHT CONSUMED BY A GUEST WITH A CANCELLABLE RESERVATION REPRESENTS A CONTRACT WHEREBY THE COMPANY HAS A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  TO PROVIDE THE ROOM NIGHT AT AN AGREED UPON PRICE. FOR CANCELLABLE RESERVATIONS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE AS EACH PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION (I.E., EACH ROOM NIGHT) IS MET. SUCH CONTRACT IS RENEWED IF THE GUEST CONTINUES THEIR STAY. FOR ROOM NIGHTS CONSUMED  BY A GUEST WITH A NON-CANCELLABLE RESERVATION, THE ENTIRE RESERVATION PERIOD REPRESENTS THE CONTRACT TERM WHEREBY THE COMPANY  HAS A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE ROOM NIGHT OR NIGHTS AT AN AGREED UPON PRICE. FOR NON-CANCELLABLE RESERVATIONS, THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE OVER THE TERM OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD (I.E., THE RESERVATION PERIOD) AS ROOM NIGHTS ARE CONSUMED.  FOR THESE RESERVATIONS, THE ROOM RATE IS TYPICALLY FIXED OVER THE RESERVATION PERIOD. THE COMPANY USES AN OUTPUT METHOD BASED  ON PERFORMANCE COMPLETED TO DATE (I.E., ROOM NIGHTS CONSUMED) TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE IT RECOGNIZES ON A DAILY BASIS  IF THE LENGTH OF A NON-CANCELLABLE RESERVATION EXCEEDS ONE NIGHT SINCE CONSUMPTION OF ROOM NIGHTS INDICATES WHEN SERVICES ARE  TRANSFERRED TO THE GUEST. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, VARIABLE CONSIDERATION MAY EXIST WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTION PRICE, SUCH AS  DISCOUNTS, COUPONS AND PRICE CONCESSIONS MADE UPON GUEST CHECKOUT.  37  IN  EVALUATING ITS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, THE COMPANY BUNDLES THE OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE GUEST THE ROOM ITSELF WITH OTHER OBLIGATIONS  (SUCH AS FREE WIFI, GRAB AND GO BREAKFAST, ACCESS TO ON-SITE LAUNDRY FACILITIES AND PARKING), AS THE OTHER OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT  DISTINCT AND SEPARABLE BECAUSE THE GUEST CANNOT BENEFIT FROM THE ADDITIONAL AMENITIES WITHOUT THE CONSUMED ROOM NIGHT. THE COMPANY\\u2019S  OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS OR SERVICES IS NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION  (I.E., PROVIDING THE ROOM AND ITS CONTENTS). THE COMPANY HAS NO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ONCE A GUEST\\u2019S STAY IS COMPLETE.  WE  ARE REQUIRED TO COLLECT CERTAIN TAXES AND FEES FROM CUSTOMERS ON BEHALF OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND REMIT THESE BACK TO THE APPLICABLE  GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES ON A PERIODIC BASIS. WE HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO ACT AS A COLLECTION AGENT. WE DO NOT RETAIN THESE TAXES  AND FEES AND, THEREFORE, THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN REVENUES. WE RECORD A LIABILITY WHEN THE AMOUNTS ARE COLLECTED AND RELIEVE THE  LIABILITY WHEN PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY OR OTHER APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY.  COMPLIANCE  WITH CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS OF NYSE AMERICAN  ON  MAY 17, 2019, THE TRUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM NYSE AMERICAN GIVING AN OFFICIAL NOTICE OF NONCOMPLIANCE OF THE TRUST WITH CONTINUED  LISTING STANDARDS OF NYSE AMERICAN LLC (THE \\u201cEXCHANGE\\u201d) BECAUSE THE TRUST FAILED TO TIMELY FILE WITH THE SECURITIES  AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \\u201cSEC\\u201d) ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 (THE \\u201cDELINQUENT  REPORT\\u201d). THIS FILING DELINQUENCY SUBJECTS THE TRUST TO THE PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 1007 OF THE NYSE AMERICAN  COMPANY GUIDE. THE REQUISITE FORM 8-K AND ASSOCIATED PRESS RELEASE WERE ISSUED ON MAY 23, 2019, AND THE TRUST FILED THE ANNUAL  FORM 10-K ON JUNE 19, 2019.  ON JULY 25, 2019, THE TRUST RECEIVED A LETTER  FROM NYSE AMERICAN GIVING OFFICIAL NOTICE THAT THE TRUST IS BACK IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NYSE AMERICAN LLC (THE \\u201cEXCHANGE\\u201d)  CONTINUED LISTING STANDARDS SET FORTH IN PART 10 OF THE NYSE AMERICAN COMPANY GUIDE (\\u201cCOMPANY GUIDE\\u201d). SPECIFICALLY,  THE TRUST HAS RESOLVED THE LISTING DEFICIENCY WITH RESPECT TO SECTIONS 134 AND 1101 OF THE COMPANY GUIDE, REFERENCED  IN THE EXCHANGE\\u2019S LETTER OF MAY 17, 2019  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES  THE  FOLLOWING NON-GAAP PRESENTATIONS OF EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\\u201c  EBITDA  \\u201d)  AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\\u201c  FFO  \\u201d) ARE MADE TO ASSIST OUR INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  ADJUSTED  EBITDA IS DEFINED AS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF LOAN COSTS, INTEREST INCOME, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION, AND NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE TRUST. WE PRESENT ADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THESE MEASUREMENTS  (A) MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ONGOING PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOTEL ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, (B) PROVIDE MORE USEFUL INFORMATION  TO INVESTORS AS INDICATORS OF OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR FUTURE DEBT PAYMENTS AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND (C) PROVIDE AN  OVERALL EVALUATION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADJUSTED EBITDA AS CALCULATED BY US MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED EBITDA REPORTED  BY OTHER COMPANIES THAT DO NOT DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA EXACTLY AS WE DEFINE THE TERM. ADJUSTED EBITDA DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED  FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO (A) GAAP NET INCOME  OR LOSS AS AN INDICATION OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR (B) GAAP CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY.  38  A RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE  TO CONTROLLING INTERESTS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018 IS APPROXIMATELY  AS FOLLOWS.

NAREIT DEVELOPED FFO AS A RELATIVE MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE OF AN EQUITY REIT TO RECOGNIZE THAT INCOME-PRODUCING REAL  ESTATE HISTORICALLY HAS NOT DEPRECIATED ON THE BASIS DETERMINED BY GAAP. THE TRUST IS AN UNINCORPORATED OHIO REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT  TRUST; HOWEVER, THE TRUST IS NOT A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST FOR FEDERAL TAXATION PURPOSES. MANAGEMENT USES THIS MEASUREMENT  TO COMPARE ITSELF TO REITS WITH SIMILAR DEPRECIABLE ASSETS. WE CONSIDER FFO TO BE AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF OUR ONGOING NORMALIZED  OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE COMPUTE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INTERPRETATION OF STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY NAREIT, WHICH MAY NOT  BE COMPARABLE TO FFO REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES THAT EITHER DO NOT DEFINE THE TERM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION  OR INTERPRET THE NAREIT DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY THAN US. FFO DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS DETERMINED  BY GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO (A) GAAP NET INCOME OR LOSS AS AN INDICATION OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  OR (B) GAAP CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY, NOR IS IT INDICATIVE OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO SATISFY  OUR CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. HOWEVER, TO FACILITATE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR HISTORICAL  OPERATING RESULTS, WE BELIEVE THAT FFO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH OUR NET INCOME OR LOSS AND CASH FLOWS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THIS IS A DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY $9.9 MILLION.  39  TOTAL 12-MONTH TRAILING NET INCOME FOR  THE SAME 12-MONTH TIME PERIOD WAS $13.2 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 447% FROM ($3.8) MILLION FOR THE SAME  12-MONTH PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, INCLUSIVE OF THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE TRUST\\u2019S YUMA HOTEL AND THE IBC  TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.  NON-CASH DEPRECIATION FOR THE CURRENT 12-MONTH  TRAILING PERIOD WAS $0.6 MILLION WITH THE 12-MONTH TRAILING PROFIT BEFORE NON-CASH DEPRECIATION TOTALING $1.3 MILLION.  FUTURE  POSITIONING  IN VIEWING THE HOTEL INDUSTRY CYCLES, THE BOARD  OF TRUSTEES DETERMINED THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO ACTIVELY SEEK BUYERS FOR OUR PROPERTIES. WE ENGAGED THE SERVICES OF SEVERAL HOTEL  BROKERS AND BEGAN INDEPENDENTLY ADVERTISING OUR HOTELS FOR SALE. WE SOLD THE ONTARIO HOTEL IN JUNE 2017 AND THE YUMA HOTEL IN OCTOBER  2018. WE CONTINUE TO INDEPENDENTLY ADVERTISE AND LIST OUR HOTELS FOR SALE, INCLUDING ON OUR WEBSITE (WWW.SUITEHOTELSREALTY.COM).

THE LISTED ASKING  PRICE IS NOT BASED ON APPRAISALS OF THE PROPERTIES.  WE  HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME LISTED EACH OF THE PROPERTIES WITH A LOCAL REAL ESTATE HOTEL BROKER WHO HAS SUCCESSFULLY SOLD FOUR OF OUR  HOTEL PROPERTIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT EACH OF THE ASSETS ARE BEING MARKETED AT A PRICE THAT IS REASONABLE IN RELATION TO ITS CURRENT  FAIR VALUE. WE PLAN TO SELL OUR REMAINING TWO HOTEL PROPERTIES WITHIN TWO YEARS, BASED ON FEEDBACK RECEIVED BY OUR LOCAL HOTEL  REAL ESTATE PROPERTY PROFESSIONAL BROKERS AND WE HAVE ENGAGED HOTEL REAL ESTATE BROKERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN THE SELLING/BUYING HOTEL  REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES FOR THE SALE OF OUR TUCSON AND ALBUQUERQUE HOTEL PROPERTIES. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE  ABLE TO SELL EITHER OR BOTH OF THE HOTEL PROPERTIES ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR WITHIN OUR EXPECTED TIME FRAME, OR AT ALL.  IT  IS FEASIBLE, BUT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REALIZE THE LISTED ASKING PRICE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HOTEL PROPERTIES OR TO SELL THEM AT ALL.  HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THE LISTED VALUES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS, COMPARABLE SALES, AND STRONG UPTURNS  IN OCCUPANCY, RATES, AND PROFITS PER HOTEL. CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE IN PART RESULTED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE RESULT,  IN OUR CHANGING ONE OR ALL OF THE LISTED ASKING PRICES.  OUR  LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO OBTAIN THE FULL BENEFIT OF OUR REAL ESTATE EQUITY AND TO PURSUE A MERGER WITH ANOTHER COMPANY,  LIKELY A PRIVATE LARGER ENTITY THAT SEEKS TO GO PUBLIC OR LIST ON THE NYSE AMERICAN EXCHANGE.

WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MAJORITY-OWNED OR CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SEASONALITY  THE  HOTELS\\u2019 OPERATIONS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT SEASONAL. THE TUCSON ARIZONA HOTEL EXPERIENCE THE HIGHEST OCCUPANCY IN  THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER (THE WINTER SEASON) AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER. THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER TENDS  TO BE THE LOWEST OCCUPANCY PERIOD AT THIS ARIZONA HOTEL. THIS SEASONALITY PATTERN CAN BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE  TRUST\\u2019S QUARTERLY REVENUES. THE HOTEL LOCATED IN NEW MEXICO HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCE THEIR MOST PROFITABLE PERIODS DURING  THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS (THE SUMMER SEASON), PROVIDING SOME BALANCE TO THE GENERAL SEASONALITY OF THE TRUST\\u2019S  HOTEL BUSINESS.  THE  SEASONAL NATURE OF THE TRUST\\u2019S BUSINESS INCREASES ITS VULNERABILITY TO RISKS SUCH AS LABOR FORCE SHORTAGES AND CASH FLOW  ISSUES. FURTHER, IF AN ADVERSE EVENT SUCH AS AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED TERRORIST ATTACK, INTERNATIONAL CONFLICT, DATA BREACH, REGIONAL  ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS SHOULD AT EITHER OF ITS TWO HOTELS, THE ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE TRUST\\u2019S REVENUES  AND PROFIT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING QUARTERLY UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019 (\\u201cANNUAL REPORT\\u201d). OUR ANNUAL REPORT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PRACTICES AND THE TRANSACTIONS THAT UNDERLIE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  WE PROVIDE A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF TRANSPORTATION, E-COMMERCE AND BUSINESS SERVICES THROUGH COMPANIES COMPETING COLLECTIVELY, OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY AND MANAGED COLLABORATIVELY, UNDER THE RESPECTED FEDEX BRAND. OUR PRIMARY OPERATING COMPANIES ARE FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION (\\u201cFEDEX EXPRESS\\u201d), INCLUDING TNT EXPRESS B.V. (\\u201cTNT EXPRESS\\u201d), THE WORLD\\u2019S LARGEST EXPRESS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY; FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE SYSTEM, INC.

THESE COMPANIES REPRESENT OUR MAJOR SERVICE LINES AND, ALONG WITH FEDEX CORPORATE SERVICES, INC. (\\u201cFEDEX SERVICES\\u201d), CONSTITUTE OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  OUR FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT PROVIDES SALES, MARKETING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATIONS, CUSTOMER SERVICE, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, BILLING AND COLLECTION SERVICES, AND CERTAIN BACK-OFFICE FUNCTIONS THAT SUPPORT OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.

PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  THE KEY INDICATORS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE.  \\u2022  THE OVERALL CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR VARIOUS SERVICES BASED ON MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY;  \\u2022  THE VOLUMES OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH OUR NETWORKS, PRIMARILY MEASURED BY OUR AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME AND SHIPMENT WEIGHT AND SIZE;  \\u2022  THE MIX OF SERVICES PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS;  \\u2022  THE PRICES WE OBTAIN FOR OUR SERVICES, PRIMARILY MEASURED BY YIELD (REVENUE PER PACKAGE OR POUND OR REVENUE PER SHIPMENT OR HUNDREDWEIGHT FOR LTL FREIGHT SHIPMENTS);  \\u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR COST STRUCTURE (CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES) TO MATCH SHIFTING VOLUME LEVELS; AND  \\u2022  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL PRICES AND OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER INCREMENTAL FUEL COSTS THROUGH OUR FUEL SURCHARGES.  MANY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY REVENUE AND VOLUME LEVELS, AND WE EXPECT THESE OPERATING EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS CONSISTENT WITH CHANGES IN REVENUES AND VOLUMES. THEREFORE, THE DISCUSSION OF OPERATING EXPENSE CAPTIONS FOCUSES ON THE KEY DRIVERS AND TRENDS IMPACTING EXPENSES OTHER THAN THOSE FACTORS STRICTLY RELATED TO CHANGES IN REVENUES AND VOLUMES.

OUR FIRST QUARTER 2020 RESULTS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION DUE TO ONE FEWER OPERATING DAY. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS OF BUSINESS FROM A LARGE CUSTOMER AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, INCREASED YIELDS AT FEDEX FREIGHT AND FEDEX GROUND AND HIGHER VOLUME AT FEDEX GROUND. LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES BENEFITED THE COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS BY APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  WE INCURRED TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES TOTALING $71 MILLION ($55 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, A $50 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE INTEGRATION EXPENSES ARE PREDOMINANTLY INCREMENTAL COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION OF TNT EXPRESS, INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL AND LEGAL FEES, SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, TRAVEL AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES, AND INCLUDE ANY RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AT TNT EXPRESS. INTERNAL SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE INCLUDED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE ASSIGNED FULL-TIME TO INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES.

AT FEDEX GROUND, REVENUES INCREASED 8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DUE TO VOLUME GROWTH AND INCREASED YIELDS. REVENUES AT FEDEX EXPRESS DECREASED 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATES AND LOWER FREIGHT POUNDS REFLECTING MACROECONOMIC WEAKNESS AND TRADE UNCERTAINTY. FEDEX FREIGHT REVENUES DECREASED 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DUE TO DECREASED AVERAGE DAILY SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE PER SHIPMENT.

IN ADDITION, ONE FEWER OPERATING DAY AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS, THE LOSS OF BUSINESS FROM A LARGE CUSTOMER AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND AND HIGHER PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS, INCLUDING HIGHER RATES AND INCREASED CAPACITY FOR SIX-DAY-PER-WEEK OPERATIONS YEAR-ROUND AT FEDEX GROUND, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, INCREASED YIELDS AT FEDEX FREIGHT AND FEDEX GROUND AND HIGHER VOLUME AT FEDEX GROUND.  THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 RESULTED IN A RECLASSIFICATION FROM OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE TO RENTALS AND LANDING FEES EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION AND MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS EXPENSE TO RENTALS AND LANDING FEES EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION. THESE AMOUNTS WERE RECLASSIFIED IN ORDER TO PROPERLY ALIGN THE LEASE AND RENTAL EXPENSES TO THE APPROPRIATE LINE ITEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW STANDARD AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING YEAR-OVER-YEAR EXPENSE CHANGE DISCUSSION.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE DECREASED 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER STAFFING TO SUPPORT VOLUME GROWTH AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND. OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE INCREASED 5% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS AT FEDEX GROUND AND HIGHER OUTSIDE SERVICE CONTRACTS AT FEDEX EXPRESS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED 9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAMS AT ALL TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS INCREASED 2% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RATES AND EXPANSION OF THE FEDEX GROUND NETWORK TO SIX-DAY-PER-WEEK OPERATIONS YEAR-ROUND IN JANUARY 2019, AS WELL AS HIGHER VOLUMES AT FEDEX GROUND. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS EXPENSE INCREASED 4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AIRCRAFT ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AT FEDEX EXPRESS.  - 33 -  FUEL  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS SHOWS OUR AVERAGE COST OF JET AND VEHICLE FUEL PER GALLON FOR THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.  FUEL EXPENSE DECREASED 12% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED FUEL PRICES. HOWEVER, FUEL PRICES REPRESENT ONLY ONE COMPONENT OF THE FACTORS WE CONSIDER MEANINGFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR BUSINESS. CONSIDERATION MUST ALSO BE GIVEN TO THE FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE WE COLLECT. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE DISCUSSION OF THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR RESULTS, WHICH IS A COMPARISON OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN THESE TWO FACTORS, IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF FUEL SURCHARGES ON THE TREND IN REVENUE AND YIELD GROWTH, WE HAVE INCLUDED THE COMPARATIVE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE FUEL SURCHARGE PERCENTAGES IN EFFECT FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF 2020 AND 2019 IN THE ACCOMPANYING DISCUSSION OF EACH OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS.  MOST OF OUR FUEL SURCHARGES ARE ADJUSTED ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE FUEL SURCHARGE IS BASED ON A WEEKLY FUEL PRICE FROM TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE WEEK IN WHICH IT IS ASSESSED. SOME FEDEX EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL FUEL SURCHARGES INCORPORATE A TIMING LAG OF APPROXIMATELY SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS.  THE MANNER IN WHICH WE PURCHASE FUEL ALSO INFLUENCES THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR CONTRACTS FOR JET FUEL PURCHASES AT FEDEX EXPRESS ARE TIED TO VARIOUS INDICES, INCLUDING THE U.S. GULF COAST INDEX. WHILE MANY OF THESE INDICES ARE ALIGNED, EACH INDEX MAY FLUCTUATE AT A DIFFERENT PACE, DRIVING VARIABILITY IN THE PRICES PAID FOR JET FUEL. FURTHERMORE, UNDER THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 70% OF OUR JET FUEL IS PURCHASED BASED ON THE INDEX PRICE FOR THE PRECEDING WEEK, WITH THE REMAINDER OF OUR PURCHASES TIED TO THE INDEX PRICE FOR THE PRECEDING MONTH AND PRECEDING DAY, RATHER THAN BASED ON DAILY SPOT RATES. THESE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF RAPIDLY CHANGING DAILY SPOT RATES ON OUR JET FUEL PURCHASES.  BECAUSE OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED SHOULD THE MARKET PRICE OF FUEL SUDDENLY CHANGE BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OR CHANGE BY AMOUNTS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN AN ADJUSTMENT IN OUR FUEL SURCHARGES, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IN THE SHORT-TERM.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL HAD A SLIGHT BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS DECREASED FUEL PRICES MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER FUEL SURCHARGES.  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW OUR FUEL SURCHARGES. ON MARCH 18, 2019, WE UPDATED THE TABLES USED TO DETERMINE OUR FUEL SURCHARGES FOR FEDEX EXPRESS U.S. DOMESTIC SERVICES AND AT FEDEX GROUND. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2018, WE UPDATED THE TABLES USED TO DETERMINE OUR FUEL SURCHARGES AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND. THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OPERATING INCOME DESCRIBED ABOVE AND FOR EACH SEGMENT BELOW EXCLUDES THE IMPACT FROM THESE TABLE CHANGES.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS DOES NOT CONSIDER THE EFFECTS THAT FUEL SURCHARGE LEVELS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN DEMAND AND SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF SERVICES PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE MAY BE IMPACTED BY FUEL COSTS. WHILE FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL SURCHARGE PERCENTAGES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, FUEL SURCHARGES REPRESENT ONE OF THE MANY INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF OUR PRICING STRUCTURE THAT IMPACT OUR OVERALL REVENUE AND YIELD. ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS INCLUDE THE MIX OF SERVICES SOLD, THE BASE PRICE AND EXTRA SERVICE CHARGES WE OBTAIN FOR THESE SERVICES AND THE LEVEL OF PRICING DISCOUNTS OFFERED.  - 34 -  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 25.2% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, COMPARED WITH 24.2% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE 2020 TAX RATE WAS IMPACTED BY DECREASED EARNINGS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS U.S. STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) FOR THE 2016 AND 2017 TAX YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER APPEALS PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE IRS\\u2019S PROPOSED AUDIT ADJUSTMENT FOR THE 2014 AND 2015 TAX YEARS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN INCOME TAX RETURN PROCEEDINGS WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN OUR BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2019.  OUTLOOK  WE EXPECT OPERATING INCOME DECLINES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020 RESULTING FROM LOWER REVENUE AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AT FEDEX GROUND.  OUR OUTLOOK ON GLOBAL TRADE HAS WEAKENED SINCE THE PREVIOUS QUARTER DUE TO ESCALATING TRADE TENSIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS, INCREASING SOFTNESS IN EUROPEAN MARKETS AND DECLINES IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN GLOBAL TRADE THAN OUR U.S. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SHIPMENTS INTERNATIONALLY. THE SOFTER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IS EXPECTED TO CREATE AN ONGOING REVENUE SHORTFALL FROM PLANNED LEVELS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC. THE COST OF MAINTAINING TWO SEPARATE NETWORKS IN EUROPE WHILE WE EXECUTE THE TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION IS EXPECTED TO COMPOUND THE IMPACT OF THE REVENUE SHORTFALL ON OUR NEAR-TERM RESULTS.  IN THE U.S. DOMESTIC PACKAGE MARKET, INCREMENTAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MODERNIZING OUR FEDEX EXPRESS NETWORK AND PERMANENTLY EXPANDING OUR FEDEX GROUND NETWORK OPERATIONS TO SEVEN DAYS PER WEEK YEAR-ROUND, COMBINED WITH SHORT-TERM VOLUME DECLINES FROM THE LOSS OF A LARGE CUSTOMER, HAS CREATED A NEAR-TERM COST-TO-VOLUME DISPARITY. HOWEVER, WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR U.S. DOMESTIC PACKAGE OPERATIONS WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN HIGHER REVENUE THAT MORE THAN OFFSETS THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS.  IN RESPONSE TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE ARE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR GLOBAL FEDEX EXPRESS AIR NETWORK TO BETTER MATCH CAPACITY WITH DEMAND. THESE CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS WILL RESULT IN ACCELERATING PLANNED AIRCRAFT RETIREMENTS OVER THE CURRENT AND NEXT FISCAL YEARS, AND WE ARE PARKING ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT AFTER THE 2020 PEAK SEASON. THESE ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND/OR IMMATERIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON COST REDUCTIONS BY LIMITING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND DEFERRING NON-CRITICAL HIRING.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020, WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION PLANS AND ARE FOCUSED ON COMPLETING PROJECTS ACROSS OUR EUROPEAN HUB AND STATION LOCATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW INTEROPERABILITY BETWEEN THE GROUND NETWORKS FOR BOTH FEDEX EXPRESS AND TNT EXPRESS PACKAGES, WHICH WILL FURTHER LOWER COSTS AS THE RELATED FEDEX EXPRESS LINEHAUL OPERATIONS ARE OPTIMIZED. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE OPERATIONAL NETWORK INTEGRATION PROCESS FOR THE KEY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, WHICH REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF INTERNATIONAL REVENUE, WORKFORCES AND FACILITIES. INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE ARE COMPLEX AND REQUIRE CONSULTATIONS WITH WORKS COUNCILS AND EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN 2020, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, INTEGRATION WORK WILL CONTINUE THEREAFTER. AFTER 2020, THE NEXT KEY INTEGRATION MILESTONES INCLUDE COMPLETING A SINGLE PORTFOLIO OF SERVICES AND AIR NETWORK INTEGRATION. WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION OF INTEGRATION EXPENSES IN THE REMAINDER OF 2020 IN THE FORM OF PROFESSIONAL FEES, OUTSIDE SERVICE CONTRACTS, SALARIES AND WAGES AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE. WE EXPECT THE AGGREGATE INTEGRATION PROGRAM EXPENSES, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AT TNT EXPRESS, TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION THROUGH 2021, AND WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS THAT WILL FURTHER TRANSFORM AND OPTIMIZE THE COMBINED BUSINESSES. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEGRATION EXPENSES AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD MAY CHANGE AS WE REVISE AND IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS.  OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020 ARE DEPENDENT ON KEY EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING MODERATE U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH, CURRENT FUEL PRICE EXPECTATIONS, NO FURTHER WEAKENING IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FROM OUR CURRENT FORECAST AND NO ADDITIONAL ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICIES AND RELATIONS.  OTHER OUTLOOK MATTERS.  FOR DETAILS ON KEY 2020 CAPITAL PROJECTS, REFER TO THE \\u201cLIQUIDITY OUTLOOK\\u201d SECTION OF THIS MD&A.

THE ALLOCATIONS OF NET OPERATING COSTS ARE BASED ON METRICS SUCH AS RELATIVE REVENUES OR ESTIMATED SERVICES PROVIDED.  THE FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT PROVIDES DIRECT AND INDIRECT SUPPORT TO OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND WE ALLOCATE ALL OF THE NET OPERATING COSTS OF THE FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT TO REFLECT THE FULL COST OF OPERATING OUR BUSINESSES IN THE RESULTS OF THOSE SEGMENTS. WE REVIEW AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS BASED ON OPERATING INCOME (INCLUSIVE OF FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT ALLOCATIONS). FOR THE FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT, PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED BASED ON THE IMPACT OF ITS TOTAL ALLOCATED NET OPERATING COSTS ON OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE ALLOCATIONS APPROXIMATE THE NET COST OF PROVIDING THESE FUNCTIONS. OUR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES ARE REFINED PERIODICALLY, AS NECESSARY, TO REFLECT CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESSES.  CORPORATE, OTHER AND ELIMINATIONS  CORPORATE AND OTHER INCLUDES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS COSTS FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CERTAIN LEGAL AND FINANCE FUNCTIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COSTS AND CREDITS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO OUR CORE BUSINESS. THESE COSTS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  ALSO INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER IS THE FEDEX OFFICE OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH PROVIDES AN ARRAY OF DOCUMENT AND BUSINESS SERVICES AND RETAIL ACCESS TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PACKAGE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES, AND THE FEDEX LOGISTICS, INC.

FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 5% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DUE TO HIGHER PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS, RESULTING FROM INCREASED CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RATES AND HIGHER VOLUMES, INCLUDING EXPANDING TO SIX-DAY-PER-WEEK OPERATIONS YEAR-ROUND STARTING IN JANUARY 2019, AS WELL AS INCREASED STAFFING COSTS TO SUPPORT NETWORK EXPANSION. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS OF BUSINESS FROM A LARGE CUSTOMER NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY VOLUME GROWTH AND INCREASED YIELDS. ADDITIONALLY, LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES BENEFITED OPERATING INCOME COMPARISONS BY APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  - 40 -  THE LEASE STANDARD RECLASS  IFICATION DISCUSSED  IN THE \\u201cOVERVIEW\\u201d SECTION  ABOVE IS EXCLUDED FROM THE  FOLLOWING YEAR-OVER-YEAR EXPENSE CHANGE DISCUSSION.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE INCREASED  1  2% IN  THE  FIRST  QUARTER  OF 2020  DUE TO  INCREASED CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RATES  AND HIGHER VOLUMES  , INCLUDING EXPANDING TO SIX-DAY  PER WEEK  OPERATIONS YEAR-ROUND,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED FUEL COSTS.  OTHER  OPERATING EXPENSE INCREASED  9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SELF-INSURANCE ACCRUALS AND INCREASED BAD DEBT EXPENSE.  SALARIES AND EMPLO  YEE BENEFITS EXPENSE INCREASED  8% IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 20  20  PRIMARILY DUE TO  ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO SUPPORT VOLUME GROWTH,  INCLUDING EXPAN  D  ING  TO SIX  -  DAY  -  PER  -  WEEK  OPERATIONS  YEAR-ROUND  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY L  OWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION  EXPENSES.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL HAD A SLIGHT BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS DECREASED FUEL PRICES MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER FUEL SURCHARGES. SEE THE \\u201cFUEL\\u201d SECTION OF THIS MD&A FOR A DESCRIPTION AND ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDER MODELS  FEDEX GROUND IS INVOLVED IN LAWSUITS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS CLAIMING THAT OWNER-OPERATORS ENGAGED UNDER OPERATING AGREEMENTS NO LONGER IN PLACE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED AS EMPLOYEES OF FEDEX GROUND, RATHER THAN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE DEFENDING JOINT-EMPLOYER CASES WHERE IT IS ALLEGED THAT FEDEX GROUND SHOULD BE TREATED AS AN EMPLOYER OF THE DRIVERS EMPLOYED BY OWNER-OPERATORS ENGAGED BY FEDEX GROUND. THESE CASES ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF LITIGATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND OURSELVES IN THESE PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT OWNER-OPERATORS ENGAGED BY FEDEX GROUND ARE PROPERLY CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THAT FEDEX GROUND IS NOT AN EMPLOYER OR JOINT EMPLOYER OF THE DRIVERS OF THESE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.  FEDEX GROUND PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO IMPLEMENT THE INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDER (\\u201cISP\\u201d) MODEL THROUGHOUT ITS ENTIRE U.S. PICKUP-AND-DELIVERY NETWORK. THE TRANSITION TO THE ISP MODEL IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED ON A DISTRICT-BY-DISTRICT BASIS AND WE ARE NOW TARGETING THE TRANSITION TO BE COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 80% OF STANDARD FEDEX GROUND VOLUME (EXCLUDING FEDEX SMARTPOST VOLUME) WAS BEING DELIVERED BY SMALL BUSINESSES OPERATING UNDER THE ISP MODEL. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TRANSITIONS WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS INCURRED AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO ANY FUTURE QUARTER.  - 41 -  FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT  FEDEX FREIGHT LTL SERVICE OFFERINGS INCLUDE PRIORITY SERVICES WHEN SPEED IS CRITICAL AND ECONOMY SERVICES WHEN TIME CAN BE TRADED FOR SAVINGS.

AVERAGE DAILY SHIPMENTS DECREASED 4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS AS A RESULT OF SOFTENING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. REVENUE PER SHIPMENT INCREASED 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BASE RATES REFLECTING OUR ONGOING YIELD MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER WEIGHT PER SHIPMENT.

THE LEASE STANDARD RECLASSIFICATION DISCUSSED IN THE \\u201cOVERVIEW\\u201d SECTION ABOVE IS EXCLUDED FROM THE FOLLOWING YEAR-OVER-YEAR EXPENSE CHANGE DISCUSSION. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE DECREASED 28% IN FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UTILIZATION OF THIRD-PARTY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED 21% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN VEHICLES AND TRAILERS.  FUEL EXPENSE DECREASED 10% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED FUEL PRICES.

SEE NOTE 1 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING ON VEHICLES AND TRAILERS AT FEDEX FREIGHT, HIGHER SPENDING RELATED TO FACILITIES AND AIRCRAFT AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND INCREASED SPENDING ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AT FEDEX SERVICES, FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX FREIGHT. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING ACROSS ALL ASSET CATEGORIES AT FEDEX GROUND. SEE \\u201cCAPITAL RESOURCES\\u201d FOR A DISCUSSION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2020 AND 2019.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE ISSUED $2.1 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT UNDER OUR CURRENT SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, COMPRISED OF $1.0 BILLION OF 3.10% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN AUGUST 2029, \\u20ac500 MILLION OF 0.45% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN AUGUST 2025 AND \\u20ac500 MILLION OF 1.30% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN AUGUST 2031. WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS TO MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR TAX-QUALIFIED U.S. DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS (\\u201cU.S. PENSION PLANS\\u201d) DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND TO REDEEM THE $400 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2.30% NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 1, 2020 AND THE \\u20ac500 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 0.50% NOTES DUE APRIL 9, 2020. THE REMAINING NET PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  IN JANUARY 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO 25 MILLION SHARES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE REPURCHASED 0.02 MILLION SHARES OF FEDEX COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $156.90 PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL OF $3 MILLION. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, 5.1 MILLION SHARES REMAINED UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. SHARES UNDER THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE REPURCHASED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING AND VOLUME OF REPURCHASES ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT, BASED ON THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS, THE MARKET PRICE OF FEDEX COMMON STOCK AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. NO TIME LIMIT WAS SET FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM, AND THE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  - 44 -  CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE, CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN AIRCRAFT, VEHICLES AND TRAILERS, TECHNOLOGY, FACILITIES, AND PACKAGE HANDLING AND SORT EQUIPMENT. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEPEND ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING PRE-EXISTING CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, ANTICIPATED VOLUME GROWTH, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, NEW OR ENHANCED SERVICES, GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION OF SERVICES, AVAILABILITY OF SATISFACTORY FINANCING AND ACTIONS OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING ACROSS ALL ASSET CATEGORIES AT FEDEX GROUND.  LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, DEBT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AND TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT AUGUST 31, 2019 INCLUDES $1.3 BILLION OF CASH IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PERMANENT REINVESTMENT STRATEGY. WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE MAJORITY OF THIS CASH WITHOUT A MATERIAL TAX COST, AS THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\\u201cTCJA\\u201d) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE COST OF REPATRIATING FOREIGN EARNINGS FROM A U.S. TAX PERSPECTIVE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF THESE FUNDS IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR U.S. DOMESTIC DEBT OR WORKING CAPITAL OBLIGATIONS.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $5.9 BILLION IN 2020, AND INCLUDE SPENDING FOR AIRCRAFT AND HUB MODERNIZATION AT FEDEX EXPRESS, INVESTMENTS THAT INCREASE OUR EFFICIENCY IN HANDLING LARGE PACKAGES AT FEDEX GROUND AND INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY ACROSS ALL TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS THAT WILL FURTHER OPTIMIZE OUR NETWORKS AND ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITIES. WE INVESTED $0.5 BILLION IN AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND EXPECT TO INVEST AN ADDITIONAL $1.0 BILLION FOR AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2020. IN ADDITION, WE ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS IN OUR FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE FEDEX EXPRESS INDIANAPOLIS HUB AND APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO MODERNIZE THE FEDEX EXPRESS MEMPHIS WORLD HUB. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2020. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING UNSECURED FINANCING, FROM BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SOURCES, ALTHOUGH THE MARKETPLACE FOR SUCH INVESTMENT CAPITAL CAN BECOME RESTRICTED DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC FACTORS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, FEDEX EXPRESS EXERCISED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL SIX B767F AIRCRAFT FOR DELIVERY IN 2022.  WE HAVE A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\\u201cSEC\\u201d) THAT ALLOWS US TO SELL, IN ONE OR MORE FUTURE OFFERINGS, ANY COMBINATION OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT SECURITIES AND COMMON STOCK.  - 45 -  WE HAVE A  $2.0 BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201cFIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d) AND A $1.5 BILLION 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \\u201c364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT\\u201d AND, TOGETHER WITH THE FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE \\u201cCREDIT AGREEMENTS\\u201d). THE FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2024 AND INCLUDES A $250 MILLION LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT. THE 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2020.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND OTHER CASH FLOW NEEDS.  SEE NOTE 3 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE TERMS AND SIGNIFICANT COVENANTS OF  THE  CREDIT AGREEMENTS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE MADE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $1.0 BILLION TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020. OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS HAVE AMPLE FUNDS TO MEET EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON AMOUNTS INCLUDED WITHIN THE OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES CAPTIONS IN THE TABLE ABOVE CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.  OTHER BUSINESS MATTERS  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, FEDEX FILED SUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SEEKING TO ENJOIN THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FROM ENFORCING PROHIBITIONS CONTAINED IN THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS (THE \\u201cEARS\\u201d) AGAINST FEDEX. FEDEX BELIEVES THAT THE EARS VIOLATE COMMON CARRIERS\\u2019 RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AS THEY UNREASONABLY HOLD COMMON CARRIERS STRICTLY LIABLE FOR SHIPMENTS THAT MAY VIOLATE THE EARS WITHOUT REQUIRING EVIDENCE THAT THE CARRIERS HAD KNOWLEDGE OF ANY VIOLATIONS.  THE CHINA STATE POST BUREAU IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE OPERATIONS OF FEDEX EXPRESS REGARDING ITS HANDLING OF CERTAIN PACKAGES WHILE ATTEMPTING TO COMPLY WITH THE EARS. FEDEX EXPRESS HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES ON THE INVESTIGATION.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES TO DEVELOP AMOUNTS REFLECTED AND DISCLOSED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MANY CASES, THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE POLICIES OR ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES THAT COULD BE USED. WE MAINTAIN A THOROUGH PROCESS TO REVIEW THE APPLICATION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND TO EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE MANY ESTIMATES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PREPARE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A COMPLEX, GLOBAL CORPORATION. HOWEVER, EVEN UNDER OPTIMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, ESTIMATES ROUTINELY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT BASED ON CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEW OR BETTER INFORMATION.  GOODWILL.  GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT HAS FALLEN BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN ANY OTHER CHANGE OF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT A REEVALUATION OF THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS REQUIRED AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, NOR DO WE BELIEVE THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS AT RISK OF FAILING IMPAIRMENT TESTING. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.  INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING NOTE 1 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THEREIN.

THE NAME WAS LATER CHANGED TO VITA PLUS INDUSTRIES, INC. AND IN 2000 THE COMPANY\\u2019S NAME WAS CHANGED TO ITS CURRENT NAME PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM.  EFFECTIVE JUNE 28, 2019 (\\u201cCLOSING DATE\\u201d), A FURTHER CHANGE OF CONTROL OCCURRED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY. PURSUANT TO A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY AND AMONG THE COMPANY, METROWORK EQUITY SDN. BHD (\\u201cSELLER\\u201d), AND COPPER HILL ASSETS INC., A BRITISH VIRGIN ISLAND CORPORATION (\\u201cBUYER\\u201d) (THE \\u201cPURCHASE AGREEMENT\\u201d), SELLER ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED AND CONVEYED TO BUYER (I) 1,563,809 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF COMPANY (\\u201cCOMMON STOCK\\u201d) AND (II) A PROMISSORY NOTE OF THE COMPANY TOTALING $355,323.48 (\\u201cPROMISSORY NOTE\\u201d). THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID BY BUYER WAS $375,000, AND SELLER ASSUMED ALL OF THE LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE CLOSING DATE.  ON THE CLOSING OF THE ABOVE TRANSACTION, MR. CHEE CHAU NG, THE SOLE OFFICER OF SELLER, RESIGNED IN ALL OFFICER CAPACITIES FROM THE COMPANY AND ANTHONY LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, MR. LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. EFFECTIVE UPON THE 10TH DAY AFTER THE MAILING OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S INFORMATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14F-1 (THE \\u201cSCHEDULE 14F-1\\u201d) TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS (THE \\u201cAPPOINTMENT DATE\\u201d), MR. NG RESIGNED AS A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. ON THAT SAME DATE, MR. LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED AS THE COMPANY\\u2019S CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY IS A SHELL COMPANY AS DEFINED IN RULE 12B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \\u201cEXCHANGE ACT\\u201d). OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OBJECTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL THROUGH A COMBINATION WITH A BUSINESS RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE, SHORT-TERM EARNINGS. THE COMPANY WILL NOT RESTRICT OUR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE TARGET COMPANIES TO ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESS, INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND, THUS, MAY ACQUIRE ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS.  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW. DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO.  (I)  FILING EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS, AND  (II)  INVESTIGATING, ANALYZING AND CONSUMMATING AN ACQUISITION.  WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH DEFERRAL OF FEES BY CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AS NECESSARY, TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGEMENT OR OTHER INVESTORS. AS OF JULY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS $0 IN CASH. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS NEEDED. CURRENTLY, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE FUTURE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCING TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPAY OUR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEN THEY COME DUE. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND A SUITABLE TARGET COMPANY AND ENTER INTO A POSSIBLE REVERSE MERGER WITH SUCH COMPANY. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S PLAN INCLUDES OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY EQUITY FINANCING THROUGH A REVERSE MERGER TRANSACTION AND/OR RELATED PARTY ADVANCES; HOWEVER THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEING AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER ACQUIRING A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT NEED SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR ITS SHARES WHILE AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF VOTING CONTROL WHICH MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY PARTY REGARDING A BUSINESS COMBINATION. ANY TARGET BUSINESS THAT IS SELECTED MAY BE A FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE COMPANY OR AN ENTITY IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OR GROWTH, INCLUDING ENTITIES WITHOUT ESTABLISHED RECORDS OF SALES OR EARNINGS. IN THAT EVENT, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS INHERENT IN THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE AND EARLY STAGE OR POTENTIAL EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN ENTITY IN AN INDUSTRY CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK, AND, ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT WILL ENDEAVOR TO EVALUATE THE RISKS INHERENT IN A PARTICULAR TARGET BUSINESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PROPERLY ASCERTAIN OR ASSESS ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS. OUR MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO EFFECT ONLY ONE BUSINESS COMBINATION, DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR LIMITED FINANCING AND THE DILUTION OF INTEREST FOR PRESENT AND PROSPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF OUR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S PLAN TO OFFER A CONTROLLING INTEREST TO A TARGET BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION. THIS LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTANTIAL RISK IN INVESTING IN US, BECAUSE IT WILL NOT PERMIT US TO OFFSET POTENTIAL LOSSES FROM ONE VENTURE AGAINST GAINS FROM ANOTHER.  WE WILL NOT ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH ANY ENTITY WHICH CANNOT PROVIDE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT OR WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AFTER CLOSING OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT. INCLUDED IN THESE REQUIREMENTS IS OUR DUTY TO FILE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS PART OF OUR FORM 8-K TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UPON CONSUMMATION OF A MERGER OR ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS OUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IF SUCH AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT CLOSING, OR WITHIN TIME PARAMETERS NECESSARY TO INSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR IF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDED DO NOT CONFORM TO THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE TARGET BUSINESS, THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS MAY PROVIDE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WILL BE VOIDABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT.  A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH A TARGET BUSINESS WILL NORMALLY INVOLVE THE TRANSFER TO THE TARGET BUSINESS OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THE SUBSTITUTION BY THE TARGET BUSINESS OF ITS OWN MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  12  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE SELECTION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION WILL BE COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY RISKY. BECAUSE OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BEING MADE IN SOME INDUSTRIES AND SHORTAGES OF AVAILABLE CAPITAL, OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRMS SEEKING THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION. SUCH PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATING OR IMPROVING THE TERMS ON WHICH ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING MAY BE OBTAINED, PROVIDING LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRINCIPALS OF AND INVESTORS IN A BUSINESS, CREATING A MEANS FOR PROVIDING INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS OR SIMILAR BENEFITS TO KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OFFERING GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN STRUCTURING ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND THE LIKE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK. POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS MAY OCCUR IN MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND AT VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, ALL OF WHICH WILL MAKE THE TASK OF COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF SUCH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL, LOCATE AND COMPLETE A MERGER WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NO REVENUE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018. IT IS UNLIKELY THE COMPANY WILL HAVE ANY REVENUES UNLESS IT IS ABLE TO EFFECT AN ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH AN OPERATING COMPANY, OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE. IT IS MANAGEMENT\\u2019 S ASSERTION THAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HINDER THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE COMPANY\\u2019S PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS SHALL BE TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $31,086, COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES INCURRED IN RELATION TO THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, FORM 10-Q AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $31,573, COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES INCURRED IN RELATION TO THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM 10-K AND FORM 10-Q AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE BROADLY SIMILAR BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF JULY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CURRENT ASSETS OF $1,000 IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PREPAID EXPENSES. THIS COMPARES WITH CURRENT ASSETS OF $4,000 IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PREPAID EXPENSES AS OF APRIL 30, 2019. THE COMPANY\\u2019S CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF JULY 31, 2019 TOTALED $373,357, $534 RELATING TO ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUALS AND $372,823 OF ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES. THIS COMPARES WITH CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $351,421 AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, COMPRISING $2,501 OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND $348,920 DUE TO RELATED PARTIES. THE COMPANY CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO SATISFY ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018.

BY COMPARISON, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $31,573 WHICH, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR A DECREASE IN PREPAYMENTS OF $2,500 AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $1,243 RESULTED IN NET CASH OF $30,316 BEING USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE COMPANY NEITHER GENERATED NOR USED FUNDS IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 AND 2018.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A TOTAL OF $30,053 FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES: $23,903 BY WAY OF ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTY ENTITLES ($6,403 FROM METROWORK AND $17,500 FROM COPPER HILL), AND $6,150 BY WAY OF CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION FROM THE COMPANY\\u2019S FORMER CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER, METROWORK.. BY COMPARISON, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $30,316 BY WAY OF ADVANCES FROM METROWORK.  THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON THE RECEIPT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT OR OTHER FINANCING TO FUND ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS PLAN OF SEEKING A COMBINATION WITH A PRIVATE OPERATING COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON CERTAIN RELATED PARTIES TO PROVIDE CONTINUED FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY OR THAT THE RELATED PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO FUND THE COMPANY\\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. AS A RESULT, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT IS MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.

SEASONALITY  THE COMPANY\\u2019S  CHILDREN\\u2019S BOOK PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION  SCHOOL-BASED BOOK CLUB AND BOOK FAIR CHANNELS AND MOST OF ITS  EDUCATION  BUSINESSES OPERATE ON A SCHOOL-YEAR BASIS; THEREFORE, THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SEASONAL.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESS CYCLE, BORROWINGS HAVE HISTORICALLY INCREASED DURING JUNE, JULY AND AUGUST, HAVE GENERALLY PEAKED IN SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER, AND HAVE BEEN AT THEIR LOWEST POINT IN MAY.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING PHILOSOPHY IS TO USE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO CREATE VALUE BY PAYING DOWN DEBT, REINVESTING IN EXISTING BUSINESSES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKING ACQUISITIONS THAT WILL COMPLEMENT ITS PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES OR ACQUIRING OTHER STRATEGIC ASSETS, AS WELL AS ENGAGING IN SHAREHOLDER ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVES, SUCH AS SHARE REPURCHASES OR DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $49.3 MILLION, LESS CURRENT BORROWINGS OF  $13.0 MILLION  AND COMMITMENTS OF  $4.9 MILLION  , RESULTING IN $31.4 MILLION OF CURRENT AVAILABILITY AT  AUGUST 31, 2019  .

MANY OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S EMPLOYEES ARE PAID HOURLY RATES RELATED TO STATE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS  THAT ARE TIED TO INFLATION INDEXES SO THAT CHANGES IN THESE LAWS WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER LABOR COSTS TO THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, FOOD ITEMS PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND PRESSURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MODEST INCREASES IN THESE COSTS CAN BE OFFSET THROUGH PRICE CHANGES AND OTHER COST CONTROL EFFORTS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE ABLE TO PASS SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS FINANCED OPERATIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH ON HAND, CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS AND LOANS FROM OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS.

WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN BORROWING REQUIRED CAPITAL TO GROW OUR BUSINESS FROM OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS. WE HAVE NO COMMITMENT FROM THEM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL VOLUNTARILY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AS NEEDED. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AS NEEDED, AND WE WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY GENERATES CASH FLOW DAILY FROM SALES IN ITS RESTAURANTS AND MANAGES ITS CASH BALANCES TO MEET ITS CURRENT OPERATING OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $175,000 ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE 28-WEEKS ENDING AUGUST 12, 2019, PRIMARILY ON EXISTING RESTAURANTS.

THE DECREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 28-WEEK PERIOD ENDING AUGUST 12, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NET LOSS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.

THE MATURITY DATES OF THE OBLIGATIONS RANGE FROM NOVEMBER 2019 TO OCTOBER 2035.  DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY BORROWED APPROXIMATELY $1,400,000 FROM MR.  WHEATON.  IN JUNE 2008, THE COMPANY BORROWED AN ADDITIONAL $592,000 FROM MR. WHEATON UNDER THE SAME TERMS. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE NOTE BALANCE FROM $1,400,000 TO $1,992,000, THE BALANCE AS OF AUGUST 12, 2019 AND JANUARY 28, 2019. THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST WERE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL ON JUNE 5, 2012. THE LOAN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S BANKRUPTCY FILING AND PURSUANT TO THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON DECEMBER 17, 2012 (THE \\u201cBANKRUPTCY PLAN\\u201d), THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE REPAID UNTIL ALL OBLIGATIONS OWED TO OTHER CREDITORS HAVE BEEN FULLY SATISFIED. INTEREST ACCRUED ON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1,992,000 AND THE INTEREST OF $197,000 FROM SEPTEMBER 28, 2011 TO DECEMBER 7, 2016 AT THE BANKRUPTCY PLAN RATE. WHEN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED INTO A FINAL DECREE AND ORDER CLOSING THE BANKRUPTCY CASE OF STAR BUFFET, INC. ON DECEMBER 7, 2016 THE COMPANY REVERTED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTEREST RATE OF 8.5%. THE COMPANY EXPENSED $105,000 TO ROBERT E. WHEATON FOR INTEREST DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019.  17  ON NOVEMBER 9, 2016, THE COMPANY BORROWED $450,000 FROM MR. ROBERT E.

WHEATON APPROXIMATELY $82,000 AND $81,000 IN PRINCIPAL DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THIS MORTGAGE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY $7,000 AND $14,000 IN INTEREST DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS  THE COMPANY PREPARES ITS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH US GAAP. THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1\\u2014SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED IN THE 2019 FORM 10-K. CERTAIN OF THESE POLICIES REQUIRE NUMEROUS ESTIMATES AND STRATEGIC OR ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE INACCURATE OR BE SUBJECT TO VARIATIONS AND WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION FOR THE REPORTED PERIOD OR IN FUTURE PERIODS. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING FACTORS, ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES IN ANY OF THESE AREAS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - BASIC IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \\u2013 DILUTED IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED CALCULATION USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD.  BASIC EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIODS. DILUTED EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED CALCULATION USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS FOR THE FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING AUGUST 12, 2019 AND AUGUST 13, 2018.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  THE COMPANY EVALUATES IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360, \\u201cPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\\u201d.  THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN IS NECESSARY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET.  IF SUCH ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. ANY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO EARNINGS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN THE AFFECTED PERIOD.  JUDGMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO REALIZE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF SUCH ASSETS ARE AFFECTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS OF THE ASSETS, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND CHANGES IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE. AS THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ONGOING EXPECTED NET CASH FLOWS AND CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REALIZE A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD.  18  BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT  BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE PROVIDED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE FOLLOWING USEFUL LIVES.  YEARS  BUILDING  40  LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS  15  -  20  (1)  FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT  5  -  8  (1)  LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE LESSER OF THE LIFE OF THE LEASE OR THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSETS. THE LIFE OF THE LEASE INCLUDES RENEWAL OPTIONS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT AT LEASE INCEPTION AS REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE EXERCISED. IF A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED LEASE OPTION IS NOT EXERCISED, ANY REMAINING UNAMORTIZED LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO OPERATING RESULTS IN THAT PERIOD.  EQUIPMENT IN NON-OPERATING UNITS OR STORED IN WAREHOUSES, WHICH IS HELD FOR REMODELING OR REPOSITIONING, IS DEPRECIATED AND IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS PROPERTY, BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT HELD FOR FUTURE USE.  BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT PLACED ON THE MARKET FOR SALE IS NOT DEPRECIATED AND IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS PROPERTY HELD FOR SALE AND RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED. MAJOR EQUIPMENT REFURBISHMENTS AND REMODELING COSTS ARE GENERALLY CAPITALIZED.  THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES REGARDING BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDE CERTAIN MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF SUCH ASSETS, THE RESIDUAL VALUES TO WHICH THE ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES THE LIFE OF EXISTING ASSETS. THESE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MAY PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAN WOULD BE REPORTED IF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED.  INCOME TAXES  OUR CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED TAXABLE INCOME IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AFTER CONSIDERING THE IMPACT ON OUR TAXABLE INCOME OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DISPARATE TREATMENT OF ITEMS, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLOSED RESTAURANTS, ESTIMATED LIABILITIES FOR SELF-INSURANCE, TAX CREDITS AND NET OPERATING LOSSES (\\u201cNOL\\u201d) FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE ALSO PROVIDED FOR NOL AND INCOME TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IS ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT REALIZE SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE TAX BENEFIT OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS. WE EVALUATE, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE BASED UPON RECENT PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, TAX REPORTING POSITIONS, AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. THE DETERMINATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS SUBJECT TO ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES SHOULD CHANGE.  CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET, NET OF EXPECTED REVERSALS OF EXISTING DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.  ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\\u201cASU\\u201d) 2018-18 \\u2013  COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS  (TOPIC 808), WHICH CLARIFIES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TOPIC 808 AND TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2018-18 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THIS STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2021. THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  19  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES UPDATE  ADOPTION OF ASC TOPIC 842: LEASES  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2016-02-  LEASES  (TOPIC 842) AND RELATED AMENDMENTS, AS OF JANUARY 29, 2019, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH PROVIDES A METHOD FOR RECORDING EXISTING LEASES AT ADOPTION WITH A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS WHICH PERMITS THE COMPANY TO NOT REASSESS (1) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES, (2) THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES, AND (3) ANY INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY ALSO ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT LEASE CONSIDERATIONS TO NOT ALLOCATE LEASE CONSIDERATIONS BETWEEN LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR REAL ESTATE LEASES. AS SUCH, REAL ESTATE LEASE CONSIDERATIONS ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE LEASE-COMPONENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR ACCORDINGLY.  THE COMPANY APPLIED A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO EFFECTIVELY ACCOUNT FOR THE OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS; THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE FINANCING LEASES. THE COMPANY EXCLUDES LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE APPLICATION OF TOPIC 842.  ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES OF $14.4 MILLION AND $15.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JANUARY 29, 2019. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPROXIMATE VALUE OF THE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DEFERRED RENT, DEFERRED RENT INCENTIVES, LEASEHOLD INTERESTS AND PREPAID RENT. THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE BEGINNING ACCUMULATED DEFICIT WAS $(501,000) DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMPARATIVE PERIODS CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED AND DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGACY GUIDANCE IN TOPIC 840.  OPERATING LEASES  THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. LEASE AGREEMENTS WILL TYPICALLY EXIST WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS REPRESENTING THE RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM. THE LEASE EXPENSE FOR LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  AS THE COMPANY\\u2019S LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, THE COMPANY WILL USE A SECURED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT LEASE COMMENCEMENT IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS INCLUDE ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE PRIOR TO LEASE COMMENCEMENT AND ARE REDUCED BY ANY LEASE INCENTIVES.  UNDER TOPIC 842, FOR ANY NEW LEASES ENTERED INTO, THE COMPANY WILL ASSESS IF IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE LEASE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE FOR INCLUSION (OR EXCLUSION) IN THE LEASE TERM WHEN THE COMPANY MEASURES THE LEASE LIABILITY. THE DEPRECIABLE LIFE OF ANY ASSETS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE LIMITED BY THE EXPECTED LEASE TERM.  CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING LEASES INCLUDE VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF SALES OVER CONTRACTUAL LEVELS. VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE OBLIGATION FOR THOSE PAYMENTS IS INCURRED. IF SUCH VARIABLE OPERATING LEASES ARISE THAT INCLUDE INCENTIVES FROM LANDLORDS IN THE FORM OF CASH, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE INCENTIVE WHEN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE MET AS A DEFERRED LIABILITY. THE DEFERRED LIABILITY IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS A REDUCTION OF RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE APPLICABLE LEASE, INCLUDING OPTIONS TO EXTEND IF THEY ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO BE EXERCISED. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THOSE LIABILITIES TO BE AMORTIZED WITHIN A YEAR AS A CURRENT LIABILITY AND THOSE GREATER THAN A YEAR AS A LONG-TERM LIABILITY. FOR PURPOSES OF RECOGNIZING THESE INCENTIVES AND RENTAL EXPENSES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, THE COMPANY USES THE DATE IT OBTAINS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE AND CONTROL THE LEASE ASSET TO BEGIN AMORTIZATION, WHICH IS GENERALLY WHEN THE COMPANY TAKES POSSESSION OF THE ASSET. PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 5 \\u2013 OPERATING LEASES IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES RELATED TO LEASES.

NIGHTCLUB SAME-STORE SALES INCREASED BY 0.1%, WHILE BOMBSHELLS SAME-STORE SALES DECREASED BY 10.6%.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL REVENUES WAS AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $37,889  $35,253  BOMBSHELLS  8,755  7,120  OTHER  383  261  $47,027  $42,634  NIGHTCLUBS  SAME-STORE SALES SLIGHTLY INCREASED BY 0.1% DURING THE QUARTER DUE TO STRONG PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLUBS IN NEW YORK, MINNESOTA AND  TEXAS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN CLUBS IN FLORIDA AND NORTH CAROLINA. SALES FROM NEW CLUBS INCLUDED $2.9 MILLION FROM THE  TWO CLUBS WE ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2018 AND $272,000 FROM A CLUB ACQUIRED IN MAY 2018.  BOMBSHELLS STILL SHOWED NEGATIVE SAME-STORE  SALES FOR THE QUARTER, BUT MONTHLY SEQUENTIAL SAME-STORE SALES HAVE BEEN IMPROVING. JUNE 2019 WAS THE FIRST SAME-STORE  SALES POSITIVE MONTH SINCE MAY 2018, AND JULY 2019 IMPROVED TO A POSITIVE DOUBLE DIGIT. NEWLY OPENED BOMBSHELLS UNITS IN FISCAL  2019 CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  TOTAL  OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A PERCENT OF REVENUES, INCREASED TO 78.8% FROM 77.7% FROM YEAR-AGO, WITH A $3.9 MILLION INCREASE, OR 11.8%.  SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE CHANGES IN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.  COST  OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED BY $835,000, OR 14.2%, MAINLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM NEWLY ACQUIRED CLUBS AND NEWLY CONSTRUCTED  BOMBSHELLS. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED TO 14.2% FROM 13.8% MAINLY DUE TO FOOD COST INEFFICIENCIES  FROM NEWLY OPENED BOMBSHELLS UNITS (26.3% FROM 24.3%), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TIGHTER FOOD COST CONTROL IN NIGHTCLUBS (11.3% FROM  11.6%).  SALARIES  AND WAGES INCREASED BY $1.8 MILLION, OR 15.9%, MAINLY DUE TO NEWLY ACQUIRED AND OPENED UNITS, ESPECIALLY THOSE NEW BOMBSHELLS  OPENING/TRAINING TEAMS WHOSE RESTAURANTS HAVE NOT YET CONTRIBUTED TO THE SALES BASE. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SALARIES  AND WAGES WERE 28.0% FROM 26.7% MAINLY DUE TO NEW BOMBSHELLS OPENING/TRAINING TEAMS.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $1.4 MILLION, OR 10.5%, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN LEGAL EXPENSES, ADVERTISING  AND MARKETING, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, AND CHARGE CARD FEES. LEGAL EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES RELATED TO THE  SEC REVIEW, WHILE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, AND CHARGE CARD FEES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASE IN UNITS.  AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES SLIGHTLY INCREASED TO 31.7% FROM 31.6%.  DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED BY $467,000, OR 23.4% DUE TO HIGHER UNIT COUNT FROM NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ACQUISITIONS.  27  OTHER  CHARGES (GAINS), NET RESULTED TO A NET GAIN OF $172,000 IN THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED TO A NET CHARGE OF $440,000 IN THE PRIOR-YEAR  QUARTER. THE SWING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A NET GAIN FROM SALE OF TWO REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND AN AIRCRAFT DURING THE CURRENT-YEAR  THIRD QUARTER COMPARED TO LAWSUIT SETTLEMENTS DURING THE PRIOR-YEAR THIRD QUARTER.  INCOME  FROM OPERATIONS  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, OUR OPERATING MARGIN WAS 21.2% AND 22.3%, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR THE  DECREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE, BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM SALARIES AND WAGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SHIFT  FROM A NET CHARGE TO A NET GAIN OF OTHER CHARGES/GAINS, NET.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $14,034  $12,584  BOMBSHELLS  686  1,391  OTHER  (111  )  (328  )  GENERAL CORPORATE  (4,635  )  (4,155  )  $9,974  $9,492  OPERATING  MARGIN FOR THE NIGHTCLUBS SEGMENT WAS 37.0% AND 35.7% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE OPERATING  MARGIN FOR BOMBSHELLS WAS 7.8% AND 19.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN NIGHTCLUBS OPERATING MARGIN WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE SHIFT  IN OTHER CHARGES/GAINS, NET. THE DECREASE IN BOMBSHELLS OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FIXED OPERATING EXPENSES AND FOOD  COST INEFFICIENCIES ESPECIALLY RELATED TO NEWLY OPENED UNITS. EXCLUDING OTHER GAINS/CHARGES, NIGHTCLUBS WOULD HAVE HAD NON-GAAP  OPERATING MARGIN OF 36.6% AND 35.4% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE BOMBSHELLS WOULD HAVE  HAD NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN OF 7.8% AND 19.5%, RESPECTIVELY.  NON-OPERATING  ITEMS  INTEREST  EXPENSE INCREASED TO $2.5 MILLION FROM $2.3 MILLION DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE MAINLY FROM ACQUISITION-RELATED DEBT, AND  A SLIGHTLY HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATE.  OUR  TOTAL OCCUPANCY COSTS, DEFINED AS THE SUM OF RENT EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WERE 7.5% AND 7.6% OF REVENUE DURING THE QUARTER  ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WERE DUE TO LOWER RENT DOLLARS IN  RELATION TO REVENUES.  INCOME  TAXES  INCOME  TAXES WERE AN EXPENSE OF $1.8 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $1.8 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. ALTHOUGH  INCOME TAX DOLLARS DID NOT HAVE A NOTICEABLE CHANGE, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 WAS AN EXPENSE  OF 24.1% COMPARED TO 25.3% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS AFFECTED BY STATE TAXES, PERMANENT DIFFERENCES,  AND TAX CREDITS, INCLUDING THE FICA TIP CREDIT.  OUR  INCOME TAX EXPENSE DECREASED BY 1.3%, WHILE OUR PRE-TAX INCOME INCREASED BY 3.4%. THIS DISPROPORTIONATE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED  BY THE QUARTERLY IMPACT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAX ACT (SEE BELOW) ON OUR PRIOR-YEAR THIRD QUARTER.  THE  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\\u201cTAX ACT\\u201d) WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, AND INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, A REDUCTION IN  THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. OUR FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL  2018 WAS 24.5% PERCENT AND REPRESENTS A BLENDED INCOME TAX RATE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR FISCAL 2019,  OUR FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE IS 21%.  ADDITIONALLY,  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 740, WE REMEASURED OUR DEFERRED TAX BALANCES TO  REFLECT THE REDUCED RATE THAT WILL APPLY WHEN THESE DEFERRED TAXES ARE SETTLED OR REALIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE REMEASUREMENT  RESULTED IN A $8.7 MILLION FULL YEAR ADJUSTMENT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 AND A CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX BENEFIT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE FISCAL  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE FOR INDIVIDUAL COST OF GOODS SOLD ITEMS PERTAINS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE  REVENUE LINE.  29  REVENUES  CONSOLIDATED  REVENUES INCREASED BY $10.8 MILLION, OR 8.6%, DUE PRIMARILY TO A 10.4% INCREASE FROM NEW UNITS, A 1.5% DECREASE FROM CLOSED UNITS,  A 0.9% DECREASE IN SAME-STORE SALES (CONTRIBUTING A 0.8% DECREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES), AND A 0.6% INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES. NIGHTCLUB  SAME-STORE SALES INCREASED BY 1.0%, WHILE BOMBSHELLS SAME-STORE SALES DECREASED BY 13.3%.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL REVENUES WAS AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $112,664  $105,914  BOMBSHELLS  22,295  18,550  OTHER  917  608  $135,876  $125,072  NIGHTCLUBS  SAME-STORE SALES GROWTH CONTINUED TO REFLECT EFFECTIVE MARKETING, MANAGEMENT AND APPEAL, COMBINED WITH A GOOD ECONOMY, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF THE PRO FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP ON OUR MINNEAPOLIS CLUBS AND THE SALES DECLINE ON OUR FLORIDA CLUBS.  BOMBSHELLS  SAME-STORE SALES DECLINE OF 13.3% IMPROVED FROM THE AVERAGE OF THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS DUE TO GRADUALLY IMPROVING SALES CAUSED  BY PRIOR YEAR HIGHER COMPARISONS. NEW BOMBSHELLS STILL NOT IN THE SAME-STORE BASE CONTRIBUTED $8.5 MILLION IN REVENUE FOR THE  PERIOD.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  TOTAL  OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A PERCENT OF REVENUES, DECREASED TO 76.2% FROM 78.5% FROM A YEAR-AGO ALTHOUGH DOLLAR VALUE INCREASED BY  $5.4 MILLION, OR 5.5%. SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE CHANGES IN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.  COST  OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED BY 7.8% MAINLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM NEWLY ACQUIRED CLUBS AND NEWLY CONSTRUCTED BOMBSHELLS.  AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS FLAT AT 13.8% FROM 13.9% MAINLY DUE TO TIGHTER FOOD COST CONTROL IN NIGHTCLUBS  (11.3% FROM 11.9%) OFFSET BY FOOD COST INEFFICIENCIES FROM NEWLY OPENED BOMBSHELLS UNITS (25.7% FROM 24.7%).  SALARIES  AND WAGES INCREASED BY $4.1 MILLION, OR 12.3%, MAINLY DUE TO NEWLY ACQUIRED AND OPENED UNITS, ESPECIALLY THOSE NEW BOMBSHELLS  OPENING/TRAINING TEAMS WHOSE RESTAURANTS HAVE NOT YET CONTRIBUTED TO THE SALES BASE. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SALARIES  AND WAGES WERE 27.4% FROM 26.5% MAINLY DUE TO PRE-OPENING TEAMS ON NEW BOMBSHELLS UNITS.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $4.1 MILLION, OR 10.5%, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN LEGAL EXPENSES, ADVERTISING  AND MARKETING, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, SUPPLIES, CHARGE CARD FEES, AND SECURITY. LEGAL EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES  RELATED TO THE SEC REVIEW, TRIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TWO CASES, AND THE ACQUISITION OF TWO CLUBS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  ADVERTISING AND MARKETING INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL EXPENSES FROM ACQUIRED CLUBS AND A NEW MARKETING PROGRAM FOR BOMBSHELLS.  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, SUPPLIES EXPENSE, CHARGE CARD FEES, AND SECURITY INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED UNIT COUNT. AS A PERCENT  OF TOTAL REVENUES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO 31.8% FROM 31.3% MAINLY DUE TO LEGAL EXPENSES.  DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED BY $912,000, OR 15.7% DUE TO HIGHER UNIT COUNT FROM NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ACQUISITIONS.  30  OTHER  CHARGES (GAINS), NET RESULTED TO A NET GAIN OF $2.3 MILLION IN THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD COMPARED TO A NET CHARGE OF $2.8  MILLION IN THE PRIOR-YEAR NINE-MONTH PERIOD. THE SHIFT WAS CAUSED BY THE NET GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION FROM THE SALE  OF SEVERAL REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.6  MILLION AND SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS OF $1.3 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  INCOME  FROM OPERATIONS  FOR  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, OUR OPERATING MARGIN WAS 23.8% AND 21.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR THE  INCREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE, BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE SHIFT FROM A NET CHARGE TO A NET GAIN OF OTHER  CHARGES/GAINS, NET.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $44,499  $37,835  BOMBSHELLS  1,543  3,247  OTHER  (406  )  (547  )  GENERAL CORPORATE  (13,364  )  (13,672  )  $32,272  $26,863  OPERATING  MARGIN FOR THE NIGHTCLUBS SEGMENT WAS 39.5% AND 35.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE OPERATING  MARGIN FOR BOMBSHELLS WAS 6.9% AND 17.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN NIGHTCLUBS OPERATING MARGIN WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE NET  GAIN IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE NET CHARGES IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN BOMBSHELLS OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO FIXED SALARIES AND WAGES AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DELEVERAGED FROM NEGATIVE SAME-STORE SALES.  NON-OPERATING  ITEMS  INTEREST  EXPENSE INCREASED TO $7.7 MILLION FROM $7.5 MILLION, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE PARTIALLY OFFSET  BY LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATE.  OUR TOTAL OCCUPANCY COSTS, DEFINED AS THE  SUM OF RENT EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, EXCLUSIVE OF PRIOR-YEAR REFINANCING-RELATED COSTS ABOVE, WERE 7.8% AND 7.6% OF REVENUE  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE HIGHER OCCUPANCY COSTS WERE DUE TO THE INTEREST EXPENSE  INCURRED AT SEVERAL BOMBSHELLS UNITS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, WHICH DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO REVENUE, AND THE DEBT INCURRED ON THE TWO  NOVEMBER 2018 CLUB ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE.  AS  PART OF OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01, WE RECORDED A $370,000 NET UNREALIZED LOSS ON THE MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES DURING  THE CURRENT YEAR. THE CUMULATIVE NET GAIN IN MARKET VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR SALE SECURITIES, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL  YEAR 2019.  INCOME  TAXES  INCOME  TAXES WERE AN EXPENSE OF $5.5 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO A BENEFIT OF $4.9 MILLION DURING  THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD OF 2019 WAS AN EXPENSE OF 22.8% COMPARED TO A  BENEFIT OF 25.0% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS AFFECTED BY STATE TAXES, PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND TAX  CREDITS, INCLUDING THE FICA TIP CREDIT, FOR BOTH YEARS WHILE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY A $9.7 MILLION  REDUCTION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY CAUSED BY NEWLY ENACTED TAX LAWS.  THE  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\\u201cTAX ACT\\u201d) WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, AND INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, A REDUCTION IN  THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. OUR FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL  2018 WAS 24.5% PERCENT AND REPRESENTS A BLENDED INCOME TAX RATE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR FISCAL 2019,  OUR FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE IS 21%.  ADDITIONALLY,  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 740, WE REMEASURED OUR DEFERRED TAX BALANCES TO  REFLECT THE REDUCED RATE THAT WILL APPLY WHEN THESE DEFERRED TAXES ARE SETTLED OR REALIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE REMEASUREMENT  RESULTED IN A $8.7 MILLION FULL YEAR ADJUSTMENT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 AND A CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX BENEFIT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR THE FISCAL  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE SEC STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118, WHICH ALLOWS COMPANIES TO RECORD PROVISIONAL  AMOUNTS DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD USED WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.  THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL MEASUREMENT ADJUSTMENTS SINCE SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 UNTIL THE END OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD ON DECEMBER  22. 2018.  31  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES  IN  ADDITION TO OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, MANAGEMENT USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SEC REGULATION G, TO CLARIFY AND ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF PAST PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.  GENERALLY, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION  OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN OR EXCLUDED FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED  AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE MONITOR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BECAUSE IT DESCRIBES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF  THE COMPANY AND HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS GAUGE OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FLOW, EXCLUDING (OR INCLUDING) SOME ITEMS THAT  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, BUT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED  FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURES CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. RELATIVE TO EACH OF THE NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES, WE FURTHER SET FORTH OUR RATIONALE AS FOLLOWS.  NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME AND NON-GAAP  OPERATING MARGIN.  WE CALCULATE NON-GAAP OPERATING  INCOME AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN BY EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ITEMS FROM INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN: (A)  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (B) IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, (C) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS,  (D) GAINS OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE, AND (E) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS ASSISTS  INVESTORS IN EVALUATING PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD CHANGES IN OUR OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT  ARE NOT A RESULT OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.  NON-GAAP  NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE  . WE CALCULATE NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER DILUTED  SHARE BY EXCLUDING OR INCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND DILUTED EARNINGS  PER SHARE. ADJUSTMENT ITEMS ARE: (A) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (B) IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, (C) COSTS AND  CHARGES RELATED TO DEBT REFINANCING, (D) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (E) GAINS OR LOSSES  ON INSURANCE, (F) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, (G) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS, AND (H) THE INCOME  TAX EFFECT OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED ADJUSTMENTS. INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX EFFECT OF THE ABOVE ADJUSTMENTS IS THE NET  EFFECT OF THE NON-GAAP PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, CALCULATED AT 22.8% AND 26.5% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF THE PRE-TAX NON-GAAP  INCOME BEFORE TAXES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE GAAP INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT).  WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING AND INCLUDING SUCH ITEMS HELP MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  ADJUSTED  EBITDA  . WE CALCULATE ADJUSTED EBITDA BY EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ITEMS FROM NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS.  (A) DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, (B) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (C) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT), (D) NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, (E) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (F) GAINS OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE,  (G) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, AND (H) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTING FOR  SUCH ITEMS HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES. ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES A CORE OPERATIONAL  PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT THAT COMPARES RESULTS WITHOUT THE NEED TO ADJUST FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHICH HAVE CONSIDERABLE  VARIATION BETWEEN DOMESTIC JURISDICTIONS. THE RESULTS ARE, THEREFORE, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF FINANCING ALTERNATIVES OF CAPITAL  EMPLOYED. WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS ONE GUIDELINE TO ASSESS OUR UNLEVERAGED PERFORMANCE RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA  IS ALSO THE TARGET BENCHMARK FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS OF NIGHTCLUBS.  WE  ALSO USE CERTAIN NON-GAAP CASH FLOW MEASURES SUCH AS FREE CASH FLOW. SEE \\u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\u201d SECTION  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  32  THE  FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT OUR NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS,  EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND PERCENTAGES).

BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF CASH WE HANDLE,  WE HAVE VERY STRINGENT CASH CONTROLS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $5.4 MILLION COMPARED TO  A POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $55,000 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, EXCLUDING ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OF $2.9 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER  30, 2018. WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL STRENGTHS. OUR  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $28.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $22.4 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR OUR BUSINESS REMAINS STRONG, AND WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THIS REPORT. AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPECTED CASH FLOWS  FROM OPERATIONS, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO MEET OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS.  WE  HAVE NOT RECENTLY RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES. INSTEAD, WE USE DEBT FINANCING TO LOWER OUR OVERALL  COST OF CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR RETURN ON STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF BORROWING FUNDS IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS  AND FROM SELLERS IN ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS, AND HAVE RECENTLY SECURED TRADITIONAL BANK FINANCING ON OUR NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  AND REFINANCING OF OUR EXISTING NOTES PAYABLE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES FROM  THOSE SOURCES. WE ALSO HAVE HISTORICALLY UTILIZED THESE CASH FLOWS TO INVEST IN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, ADULT NIGHTCLUBS AND RESTAURANTS/SPORTS  BARS.

WE PAID QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF $0.03  PER SHARE DURING EACH OF THE CURRENT- AND PRIOR-YEAR QUARTERS.  35  ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, THE COMPANY  RAISED $2.35 MILLION THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF 12% UNSECURED PROMISSORY NOTES TO CERTAIN INVESTORS, WHICH NOTES MATURE ON  NOVEMBER 1, 2021. THE NOTES PAY INTEREST-ONLY IN EQUAL MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS, WITH A LUMP SUM PRINCIPAL PAYMENT AT MATURITY.  AMONG THE PROMISSORY NOTES ARE TWO NOTES WITH A PRINCIPAL OF $450,000 AND $200,000. THE $450,000 NOTE WAS IN EXCHANGE FOR A  $300,000 12% NOTE AND THE $200,000 NOTE WAS IN EXCHANGE FOR A $100,000 NOTE, BOTH OF WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAY 1, 2017  FINANCING TO ACQUIRE SCARLETT\\u2019S CABARET IN MIAMI. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE $2.35 MILLION BORROWING IS A $500,000 NOTE  BORROWED FROM A RELATED PARTY AND TWO NOTES TOTALING $400,000 BORROWED FROM A NON-OFFICER EMPLOYEE AND A FAMILY MEMBER OF  A NON-OFFICER EMPLOYEE IN WHICH THE TERMS OF THE NOTES ARE THE SAME AS THE REST OF THE LENDER GROUP. SEE NOTES 6 AND 13 TO  OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ON  DECEMBER 6, 2018, THE COMPANY AMENDED THE $5.0 MILLION SHORT-TERM NOTE PAYABLE RELATED TO THE SCARLETT\\u2019S ACQUISITION, WHICH  HAD A REMAINING BALANCE OF $3.0 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 6, 2018, EXTENDING THE MATURITY DATE FROM MAY 8, 2019, AS PREVIOUSLY AMENDED,  TO MAY 8, 2020. SEE NOTE 6 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ON  DECEMBER 11, 2018, THE COMPANY PURCHASED AN AIRCRAFT FOR $2.8 MILLION WITH A $554,000 DOWN PAYMENT AND FINANCED THE REMAINING  $2.2 MILLION WITH A 5.49% PROMISSORY NOTE PAYABLE IN 20 YEARS WITH MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF $15,118, INCLUDING INTEREST.  ON  FEBRUARY 8, 2019, THE COMPANY REFINANCED A ONE-YEAR BANK NOTE WITH A BALANCE OF $1.5 MILLION, BEARING AN INTEREST RATE OF 6.1%,  WITH A CONSTRUCTION LOAN WITH ANOTHER BANK, WHICH HAS AN INTEREST RATE OF 6.0% ADJUSTED AFTER FIVE YEARS TO PRIME PLUS 0.5% WITH  A 6.0% FLOOR PER ANNUM. THE NEW CONSTRUCTION LOAN, WHICH HAS A MAXIMUM AVAILABILITY OF $4.1 MILLION, MATURES IN 252 MONTHS FROM  CLOSING DATE AND IS PAYABLE INTEREST-ONLY FOR THE FIRST 12 MONTHS, THEN PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF $29,571 MONTHLY FOR THE NEXT  48 MONTHS, AND THE REMAINING TERM MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST BASED ON THE ADJUSTED INTEREST RATE. THE COMPANY  PAID APPROXIMATELY $69,000 IN LOAN COSTS OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $19,600 WAS CAPITALIZED AS DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ON THE NEW CONSTRUCTION  LOAN WITH THE REMAINING CHARGED TO INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY ALSO WROTE OFF THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  OF THE OLD BANK NOTE TO INTEREST EXPENSE.  INCLUDED IN THE BALANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 IS A $200,000 NOTE, THAT IS A PART OF THE MAY 1, 2017 FINANCING, BORROWED FROM A NON-OFFICER  EMPLOYEE IN WHICH THE TERMS OF THE NOTE ARE THE SAME AS THE REST OF THE LENDER GROUP.  MANAGEMENT  ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP CASH FLOW MEASURES SUCH AS FREE CASH FLOW. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES LESS MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE USE FREE CASH FLOW AS THE BASELINE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CAPITAL  ALLOCATION STRATEGY.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $28,414  $22,411  LESS: MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  2,072  1,847  FREE CASH FLOW  $26,342  $20,564  OUR  FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE CURRENT-YEAR NINE-MONTH PERIOD INCREASED BY 28.1% COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THOUGH  WE GENERATED A SIZEABLE AMOUNT OF FREE CASH FLOW DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE STILL ENDED WITH A NET DECREASE  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS FROM THE MOST RECENT YEAR-END DUE TO OUR ACQUISITION OF TWO NEW CLUBS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW  BOMBSHELLS UNITS.  OTHER  THAN THE NOTES PAYABLE FINANCING DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY EVENT OR TREND THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANTLY  AFFECT LIQUIDITY. IN THE EVENT SUCH A TREND DEVELOPS, WE BELIEVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS WILL  BE ADEQUATELY MET BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. IN OUR OPINION, WORKING CAPITAL IS NOT A TRUE INDICATOR OF OUR FINANCIAL STATUS.  TYPICALLY, BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY CARRY CURRENT LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF CURRENT ASSETS BECAUSE BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY  RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY IMMEDIATE PAYMENT FOR SALES, WITH NOMINAL RECEIVABLES, WHILE INVENTORIES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES NORMALLY  CARRY LONGER PAYMENT TERMS. VENDORS AND PURVEYORS OFTEN REMAIN FLEXIBLE WITH PAYMENT TERMS, PROVIDING BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY  WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO ADJUST TO SHORT-TERM BUSINESS DOWN TURNS. WE CONSIDER THE PRIMARY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL STATUS TO BE THE  LONG-TERM TREND OF REVENUE GROWTH, THE MIX OF SALES REVENUES, OVERALL CASH FLOW, PROFITABILITY FROM OPERATIONS AND THE LEVEL OF  LONG-TERM DEBT.  36  THE  FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF SUCH INDICATORS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30.  INCREASE  INCREASE  2019  (DECREASE)  2018  (DECREASE)  2017  SALES OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES  $56,366  6.7%  $52,835  19.8%  $44,085  SALES OF FOOD AND MERCHANDISE  19,175  13.4%  16,906  28.1%  13,201  SERVICE REVENUES  51,609  6.8%  48,338  12.4%  42,995  OTHER  8,726  24.8%  6,993  29.4%  5,405  TOTAL REVENUES  135,876  8.6%  125,072  18.3%  105,686  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $28,414  26.8%  $22,411  25.2%  $17,897  ADJUSTED EBITDA*  $36,631  3.4%  $35,432  27.8%  $27,715  FREE CASH FLOW*  $26,342  28.1%  $20,564  23.9%  $16,592  LONG-TERM DEBT (END OF PERIOD)  $146,579  11.7%  $131,255  4.8%  $125,268  *  SEE DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW ABOVE IN THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SUBSECTION OF RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS.  SHARE  REPURCHASE  WE  PURCHASED 102,113 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $23.15 PER SHARE DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  WHILE WE DID NOT PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. IN JANUARY 2019, THE COMPANY\\u2019S BOARD  OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $10.0 MILLION TO REPURCHASE THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAVE  $10.8 MILLION REMAINING TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  OTHER  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED FINANCING OTHER THAN THE NOTES PAYABLE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE, IF AT ALL, SHOULD THE  NEED ARISE.  WE  BELIEVE THAT THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY STANDARD OF TREATING ENTERTAINERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS PROVIDES US WITH SAFE  HARBOR PROTECTION TO PRECLUDE PAYROLL TAX ASSESSMENT FOR PRIOR YEARS. WE HAVE PREPARED PLANS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROTECT OUR  PROFITABILITY IN THE EVENT THAT THE SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INDUSTRY IS REQUIRED IN ALL STATES TO CONVERT DANCERS WHO ARE NOW  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INTO EMPLOYEES.  THE  SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO PRICE, SERVICE AND LOCATION, AS WELL AS THE PROFESSIONALISM  OF THE ENTERTAINMENT. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE FUTURE, THERE CAN  BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR HIGH LEVEL OF NAME RECOGNITION AND PRESTIGE WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE.  IMPACT  OF INFLATION  WE  HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL OVERALL IMPACT FROM INFLATION IN OUR OPERATIONS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED  BY COMPETITION, WE HAVE MANAGED TO RECOVER INCREASED COSTS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO. HOWEVER, THERE CAN  BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  37  SEASONALITY  OUR  NIGHTCLUB OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED REDUCED REVENUES FROM APRIL THROUGH SEPTEMBER  (OUR FISCAL THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS) WITH THE STRONGEST OPERATING RESULTS OCCURRING DURING OCTOBER THROUGH MARCH (OUR FISCAL  FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS). OUR REVENUES IN CERTAIN MARKETS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY SPORTING EVENTS THAT CAUSE UNUSUAL CHANGES IN  SALES FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  CAPITAL  ALLOCATION STRATEGY  OUR  CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY PROVIDES US WITH DISCIPLINED GUIDELINES ON HOW WE SHOULD USE OUR FREE CASH FLOWS; PROVIDED HOWEVER,  THAT WE MAY DEVIATE FROM THIS STRATEGY IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING  ACTIVITIES MINUS MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. USING THE AFTER-TAX YIELD OF BUYING OUR OWN STOCK AS BASELINE, WE BELIEVE WE  ARE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER INVESTMENT DECISIONS UNLESS THERE IS ANOTHER STRATEGIC RATIONALE, IN MANAGEMENT\\u2019S OPINION.  BASED  ON OUR CURRENT CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY.  \\u25cf  WE  CONSIDER BUYING BACK OUR OWN STOCK IF THE AFTER-TAX YIELD ON FREE CASH FLOW CLIMBS OVER 10%;  \\u25cf  WE  CONSIDER DISPOSING OF UNDERPERFORMING UNITS TO FREE UP CAPITAL FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE USE;  \\u25cf  WE  CONSIDER ACQUIRING OR DEVELOPING OUR OWN CLUBS OR RESTAURANTS THAT WE BELIEVE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM CASH  ON CASH RETURN OF 25%-33%, ABSENT AN OTHERWISE STRATEGIC RATIONALE;  \\u25cf  WE  CONSIDER PAYING DOWN OUR MOST EXPENSIVE DEBT IF IT MAKES SENSE ON A TAX ADJUSTED BASIS, OR THERE IS AN OTHERWISE STRATEGIC  RATIONALE.  GROWTH  STRATEGY  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR NIGHTCLUB OPERATIONS CAN CONTINUE TO GROW ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH CAREFUL ENTRY INTO MARKETS AND DEMOGRAPHIC  SEGMENTS WITH HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING: (I) TO ACQUIRE EXISTING UNITS IN LOCATIONS THAT  ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR GROWTH AND INCOME TARGETS AND WHICH APPEAR RECEPTIVE TO THE UPSCALE CLUB FORMULA WE HAVE DEVELOPED; (II)  TO OPEN NEW UNITS AFTER MARKET ANALYSIS; (III) TO FRANCHISE OUR BOMBSHELLS BRAND; (IV) TO FORM JOINT VENTURES OR PARTNERSHIPS  TO REDUCE START-UP AND OPERATING COSTS, WITH US CONTRIBUTING EQUITY IN THE FORM OF OUR BRAND NAME AND MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE; (V)  TO DEVELOP NEW CLUB CONCEPTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR MANAGEMENT AND MARKETING SKILLS; (VI) TO DEVELOP AND OPEN OUR RESTAURANT  CONCEPTS AS OUR CAPITAL AND MANPOWER ALLOW; AND (VII) TO CONTROL THE REAL ESTATE IN CONNECTION WITH CLUB OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH  SOME UNITS MAY BE IN LEASED PREMISES.  WE  BELIEVE THAT BOMBSHELLS CAN GROW ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH CAREFUL ENTRY INTO MARKETS AND DEMOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS WITH HIGH GROWTH  POTENTIAL. ALL SEVEN OF THE CURRENTLY EXISTING BOMBSHELLS ARE LOCATED IN TEXAS. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY IS TO DIVERSIFY OUR OPERATIONS  WITH THESE UNITS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE SOB LICENSES, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. WHILE WE ARE SEARCHING FOR ADULT  NIGHTCLUBS TO ACQUIRE, WE ARE ABLE TO ALSO SEARCH FOR RESTAURANT/SPORTS BAR LOCATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INCOME TARGETS.  WE OPENED TWO BOMBSHELLS IN FISCAL  2019, ONE THAT OPENED IN DECEMBER 2018 AND ANOTHER THAT OPENED IN MARCH 2019. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO BOMBSHELLS PROJECTS UNDER  CONSTRUCTION, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO OPEN IN EARLY FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  WE  CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE NEW NIGHTCLUBS AND ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING NEW LOCATIONS THAT FIT OUR BUSINESS MODEL  AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL CLUBS MAY REQUIRE US TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL DEBT OR ISSUE OUR COMMON  STOCK, OR BOTH. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE,  IF AT ALL, SHOULD THE NEED ARISE. AN INABILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCING COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROWTH  STRATEGY.  38\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\", \"CIK\": 935419, \"Date\": \"2019-09-24T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"RICK\", \"Name\": \"Ricks Cabaret International Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 5810.0, \"Business\": \"TX\", \"Incorporated\": \"TX\", \"IRS\": 760037324.0, \"key\": \"20190924RICK\", \"labelr1\": 6.311207834602832, \"labelr2\": 3.83828045035824, \"labelr3\": 3.40068999507147, \"labelr4\": -1.4299332697807468, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5707024, \"prof1\": 0.4292977, \"return1&2\": 0.9009275357153596, \"return1&2&3\": 0.8702897831454435, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.8827343462981428, \"return2\": 0.9616171954964176, \"return1\": 0.9368879216539716, \"return3\": 0.9659931000492852, \"return4\": 1.0142993326978074, \"1_day_return\": 6.311207834602839, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.014449924415743944, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": -0.0, \"indexx\": 2425, \"returnpred\": -6.311207834602832, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9368879216539717, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.7956714945374861, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9079177892646921, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0270450083643643, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0326476288138133}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 2429, \"level_0\": 2493, \"index\": 33218, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

ORGANIC SALES INCREASED 1%.  \\u2022  FOOD SAFETY SEGMENT SALES WERE $51.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, A DECREASE OF 2% COMPARED TO $52.2 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. ORGANIC SALES IN THIS SEGMENT ALSO DECREASED 2%, AFTER EXCLUDING A MINOR CONTRIBUTION FROM THE AUGUST 1, 2018 ACQUISITION OF CLARUS LABS.  \\u2022  ANIMAL SAFETY SEGMENT SALES WERE $50.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AN INCREASE OF 6% COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER SALES OF $47.4 MILLION. ORGANIC SALES IN THIS SEGMENT INCREASED 5%, WITH THE ACQUISITIONS OF LIVESTOCK GENETICS (SEPTEMBER 2018) AND DELTA GENOMICS (JANUARY 2019) PROVIDING THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE.  \\u2022  INTERNATIONAL SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE 37.5% OF TOTAL SALES COMPARED TO 39.9% OF TOTAL SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \\u2022  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 17.0% COMPARED TO AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 11.1% IN THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER. THE PRIOR YEAR\\u2019S FIRST QUARTER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTIONS.  \\u2022  NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $14.7 MILLION, OR $0.28 PER DILUTED SHARE, A DECREASE OF 4% COMPARED TO $15.2 MILLION, OR $0.29 PER SHARE, FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \\u2022  CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $23.7 MILLION, COMPARED TO $16.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  NEOGEN\\u2019S RESULTS REFLECT A 4% DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. INTERNATIONAL GROWTH IN THIS QUARTER WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY CURRENCY RATES, THE LOSS OF FORENSICS BUSINESS IN BRAZIL AND A LARGE PRIOR YEAR  NON-RECURRING  GOVERNMENT SALE, ALSO IN BRAZIL. REVENUE CHANGES, EXPRESSED IN PERCENTAGES, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR ARE AS FOLLOWS FOR EACH OF OUR INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS.

NEOGEN EUROPE\\u2019S 4% DECLINE IN REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 2% DECREASE IN SALES OF NATURAL TOXINS TEST KITS; PRIOR YEAR SALES IN THIS CATEGORY WERE ENHANCED DUE TO A MILD DEOXYNIVALENOL (DON) OUTBREAK IN FRANCE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED TESTING IN THAT PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED A LARGE EQUIPMENT SALE THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT YEAR. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE DECLINES WERE STRONG SALES OF CLEANERS AND DISINFECTANTS.  AT OUR BRAZILIAN OPERATIONS, THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER INCLUDED THE FINAL SHIPMENT OF A LARGE  NON-RECURRING  INSECTICIDE ORDER TO A GOVERNMENT HEALTH ORGANIZATION. ADDITIONALLY, FORENSIC SALES IN BRAZIL DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO LOST BUSINESS FROM A LARGE COMMERCIAL LABORATORY THAT CONVERTED THEIR TESTING PROTOCOL TO  A HIGHER THROUGHPUT METHOD  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE LOWER REVENUES, SALES OF OUR AFLATOXIN TEST KITS ROSE 57% AS WE CONTINUED TO GAIN MARKET SHARE OF CORN TESTING IN BRAZIL. AT NEOGEN LATINOAMERICA, THE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER WAS LED BY SALES OF NATURAL TOXINS TEST KITS DUE TO MARKET SHARE GAINS  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF BIOSECURITY PRODUCTS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SERVICE REVENUE, WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF GENOMICS SERVICES TO ANIMAL PROTEIN AND COMPANION ANIMAL MARKETS, WAS $19.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF 17% OVER PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER REVENUES OF $16.7 MILLION, WITH MINOR CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF LIVESTOCK GENETICS (SEPTEMBER 2018) AND DELTA GENOMICS (JANUARY 2019). THE GROWTH WAS LED BY INCREASES OF GENOMIC TESTING SERVICE REVENUES TO THE COMPANION ANIMAL AND GLOBAL BEEF AND DAIRY CATTLE MARKETS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31,  INCREASE/  2019  2018  (DECREASE)%  (IN THOUSANDS)  FOOD SAFETY  NATURAL TOXINS, ALLERGENS & DRUG RESIDUES  $20,115  $18,838  $1,277  7%  BACTERIAL & GENERAL SANITATION  10,316  10,467  (151  )  (1  )%  CULTURE MEDIA & OTHER  11,279  12,217  (938  )  (8  )%  RODENTICIDES, INSECTICIDES & DISINFECTANTS  5,449  6,625  (1,176  )  (18  )%  GENOMICS SERVICES  3,862  4,036  (174  )  (4  )%  $51,021  $52,183  $(1,162  )  (2  )%  ANIMAL SAFETY  LIFE SCIENCES  $1,723  $2,080  $(357  )  (17  )%  VETERINARY INSTRUMENTS & DISPOSABLES  11,336  10,404  932  9%  ANIMAL CARE & OTHER  6,405  6,398  7  0%  RODENTICIDES, INSECTICIDES & DISINFECTANTS  16,718  17,146  (428  )  (2  )%  GENOMICS SERVICES  14,221  11,415  2,806  25%  $50,403  $47,443  $2,960  6%  TOTAL REVENUES  $101,424  $99,626  $1,798  2%  FOOD SAFETY  NATURAL TOXINS, ALLERGENS & DRUG RESIDUES \\u2013  SALES IN THIS CATEGORY INCREASED 7% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, LED BY A 9% INCREASE IN SALES OF NATURAL TOXINS TEST KITS PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET SHARE GAINS OF AFLATOXIN KITS IN BRAZIL. SALES OF ALLERGEN TEST KITS INCREASED 8% WHILE SALES OF DAIRY DRUG RESIDUE TEST KITS DECREASED 3%.  BACTERIAL & GENERAL SANITATION \\u2013  REVENUES IN THIS CATEGORY DECREASED 1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER, DUE TO LOWER EQUIPMENT SALES COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR, RESULTING FROM BACKORDERS OF EQUIPMENT FROM OUR PRIMARY SUPPLIER. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECREASE WAS A 12% INCREASE IN SALES OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PRODUCT LINE AND A 20% INCREASE IN SALES OF  LISTERIA  TEST KITS, AS WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE WITH OUR  LISTERIA  RIGHT NOW TEST KIT.  CULTURE MEDIA & OTHER \\u2013  SALES IN THIS CATEGORY DECREASED 8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES SALES OF FORENSIC TEST KITS SOLD WITHIN BRAZIL, WHICH DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, AS A LARGE CUSTOMER MOVED TO  A HIGHER THROUGHPUT METHOD  . SALES OF NEOGEN CULTURE MEDIA WERE DOWN 4%, DUE PRIMARILY TO ORDER TIMING FROM A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS AND LARGE U.S. CUSTOMERS.  RODENTICIDES, INSECTICIDES & DISINFECTANTS \\u2013  SALES OF PRODUCTS IN THIS CATEGORY SOLD THROUGH OUR FOOD SAFETY OPERATIONS DECREASED 18% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE DECREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE FINAL SHIPMENT OF A LARGE  NON-RECURRING  INSECTICIDE ORDER TO A GOVERNMENT HEALTH ORGANIZATION IN BRAZIL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. A DECLINE IN DISINFECTANT SALES IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND RODENTICIDE SALES IN MEXICO, BOTH DUE TO ORDER TIMING FROM DISTRIBUTORS, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN THIS CATEGORY IN THE FIRST QUARTER. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS WAS A 6% INCREASE IN SALES AT U.K.-BASED QUAT-CHEM AND AN INCREASE IN SALES OF DISINFECTANT PRODUCTS IN CHINA, THE RESULT OF INCREASED DEMAND IN THE PORK MARKET CAUSED BY THE AFRICAN SWINE FEVER VIRUS OUTBREAK IN THAT COUNTRY.  GENOMICS SERVICES \\u2013  SALES OF GENOMICS SERVICES SOLD THROUGH OUR FOOD SAFETY OPERATIONS DECREASED 4% IN THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IS DUE TO LOWER SALES IN CHINA, AS TESTING IN THE PORK INDUSTRY DECLINED DUE TO ANIMAL LOSSES SUFFERED AS THE RESULT OF THE AFRICAN SWINE FEVER VIRUS. THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE BRITISH POUND ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE; IN LOCAL CURRENCY, GENOMICS SALES THROUGH OUR NEOGEN EUROPE OPERATION INCREASED 4%.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANIMAL SAFETY  LIFE SCIENCES \\u2013  SALES IN THIS CATEGORY DECREASED 17% IN THE FIRST QUARTER. THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER INCLUDED SALES TO A COMMERCIAL LABORATORY CUSTOMER THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO OUR BRAZILIAN OPERATION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  VETERINARY INSTRUMENTS & DISPOSABLES \\u2013  REVENUES IN THIS CATEGORY INCREASED 9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, LED BY GROWTH IN DISPOSABLE SYRINGES AND MARKING PRODUCTS DUE TO MARKET SHARE GAINS, OFFSETTING A 17% DECREASE IN DETECTABLE NEEDLES.  ANIMAL CARE & OTHER \\u2013  SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS WERE FLAT IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS WITH DISTRIBUTORS ARE RECORDED AS A CONTRA REVENUE WITHIN THIS CATEGORY. ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE AMOUNTS, WHICH CAN VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER, RESULTED IN A HIGHER REDUCTION OF REVENUE IN THE CURRENT YEAR FIRST QUARTER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR.
